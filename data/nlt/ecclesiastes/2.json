  "I said to myself, “Come on, let’s try pleasure. Let’s look for the ‘good things’ in life.” But I found that this, too, was meaningless.",
  "So I said, “Laughter is silly. What good does it do to seek pleasure?”",
  "After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. And while still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world.",
  "I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards.",
  "I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees.",
  "I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves.",
  "I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned large herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me.",
  "I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire!",
  "So I became greater than all who had lived in Jerusalem before me, and my wisdom never failed me.",
  "Anything I wanted, I would take. I denied myself no pleasure. I even found great pleasure in hard work, a reward for all my labors.",
  "But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all so meaningless—like chasing the wind. There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere.",
  "So I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and madness (for who can do this better than I, the king?).",
  "I thought, “Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness.",
  "For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.” Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate.",
  "Both will die. So I said to myself, “Since I will end up the same as the fool, what’s the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!”",
  "For the wise and the foolish both die. The wise will not be remembered any longer than the fool. In the days to come, both will be forgotten.",
  "So I came to hate life because everything done here under the sun is so troubling. Everything is meaningless—like chasing the wind.",
  "I came to hate all my hard work here on earth, for I must leave to others everything I have earned.",
  "And who can tell whether my successors will be wise or foolish? Yet they will control everything I have gained by my skill and hard work under the sun. How meaningless!",
  "So I gave up in despair, questioning the value of all my hard work in this world.",
  "Some people work wisely with knowledge and skill, then must leave the fruit of their efforts to someone who hasn’t worked for it. This, too, is meaningless, a great tragedy.",
  "So what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety?",
  "Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief; even at night their minds cannot rest. It is all meaningless.",
  "So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God.",
  "For who can eat or enjoy anything apart from him?",
  "God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to those who please him. But if a sinner becomes wealthy, God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him. This, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind."
