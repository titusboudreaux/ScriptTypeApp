  "When the Lamb broke the seventh seal on the scroll, there was silence throughout heaven for about half an hour.",
  "I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven trumpets.",
  "Then another angel with a gold incense burner came and stood at the altar. And a great amount of incense was given to him to mix with the prayers of God’s people as an offering on the gold altar before the throne.",
  "The smoke of the incense, mixed with the prayers of God’s holy people, ascended up to God from the altar where the angel had poured them out.",
  "Then the angel filled the incense burner with fire from the altar and threw it down upon the earth; and thunder crashed, lightning flashed, and there was a terrible earthquake.",
  "Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow their mighty blasts.",
  "The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth. One-third of the earth was set on fire, one-third of the trees were burned, and all the green grass was burned.",
  "Then the second angel blew his trumpet, and a great mountain of fire was thrown into the sea. One-third of the water in the sea became blood,",
  "one-third of all things living in the sea died, and one-third of all the ships on the sea were destroyed.",
  "Then the third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch. It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs of water.",
  "The name of the star was Bitterness. It made one-third of the water bitter, and many people died from drinking the bitter water.",
  "Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet, and one-third of the sun was struck, and one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars, and they became dark. And one-third of the day was dark, and also one-third of the night.",
  "Then I looked, and I heard a single eagle crying loudly as it flew through the air, “Terror, terror, terror to all who belong to this world because of what will happen when the last three angels blow their trumpets.”"
