  "I trust in the Lord for protection. So why do you say to me, “Fly like a bird to the mountains for safety!",
  "The wicked are stringing their bows and fitting their arrows on the bowstrings. They shoot from the shadows at those whose hearts are right.",
  "The foundations of law and order have collapsed. What can the righteous do?”",
  "But the Lord is in his holy Temple; the Lord still rules from heaven. He watches everyone closely, examining every person on earth.",
  "The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked. He hates those who love violence.",
  "He will rain down blazing coals and burning sulfur on the wicked, punishing them with scorching winds.",
  "For the righteous Lord loves justice. The virtuous will see his face."
