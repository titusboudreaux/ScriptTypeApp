  "Help, O Lord, for the godly are fast disappearing! The faithful have vanished from the earth!",
  "Neighbors lie to each other, speaking with flattering lips and deceitful hearts.",
  "May the Lord cut off their flattering lips and silence their boastful tongues.",
  "They say, “We will lie to our hearts’ content. Our lips are our own—who can stop us?”",
  "The Lord replies, “I have seen violence done to the helpless, and I have heard the groans of the poor. Now I will rise up to rescue them, as they have longed for me to do.”",
  "The Lord’s promises are pure, like silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times over.",
  "Therefore, Lord, we know you will protect the oppressed, preserving them forever from this lying generation,",
  "even though the wicked strut about, and evil is praised throughout the land."
