[
  "When the Israelites escaped from Egypt— when the family of Jacob left that foreign land—",
  "the land of Judah became God’s sanctuary, and Israel became his kingdom.",
  "The Red Sea saw them coming and hurried out of their way! The water of the Jordan River turned away.",
  "The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs!",
  "What’s wrong, Red Sea, that made you hurry out of their way? What happened, Jordan River, that you turned away?",
  "Why, mountains, did you skip like rams? Why, hills, like lambs?",
  "Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob.",
  "He turned the rock into a pool of water; yes, a spring of water flowed from solid rock."
