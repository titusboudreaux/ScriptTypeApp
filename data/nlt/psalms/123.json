  "I lift my eyes to you, O God, enthroned in heaven.",
  "We keep looking to the Lord our God for his mercy, just as servants keep their eyes on their master, as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal.",
  "Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy, for we have had our fill of contempt.",
  "We have had more than our fill of the scoffing of the proud and the contempt of the arrogant."
