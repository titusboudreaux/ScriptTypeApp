[
  "I cry out to the Lord; I plead for the Lord’s mercy.",
  "I pour out my complaints before him and tell him all my troubles.",
  "When I am overwhelmed, you alone know the way I should turn. Wherever I go, my enemies have set traps for me.",
  "I look for someone to come and help me, but no one gives me a passing thought! No one will help me; no one cares a bit what happens to me.",
  "Then I pray to you, O Lord. I say, “You are my place of refuge. You are all I really want in life.",
  "Hear my cry, for I am very low. Rescue me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me.",
  "Bring me out of prison so I can thank you. The godly will crowd around me, for you are good to me.”"
