  "What mighty praise, O God, belongs to you in Zion. We will fulfill our vows to you,",
  "for you answer our prayers. All of us must come to you.",
  "Though we are overwhelmed by our sins, you forgive them all.",
  "What joy for those you choose to bring near, those who live in your holy courts. What festivities await us inside your holy Temple.",
  "You faithfully answer our prayers with awesome deeds, O God our savior. You are the hope of everyone on earth, even those who sail on distant seas.",
  "You formed the mountains by your power and armed yourself with mighty strength.",
  "You quieted the raging oceans with their pounding waves and silenced the shouting of the nations.",
  "Those who live at the ends of the earth stand in awe of your wonders. From where the sun rises to where it sets, you inspire shouts of joy.",
  "You take care of the earth and water it, making it rich and fertile. The river of God has plenty of water; it provides a bountiful harvest of grain, for you have ordered it so.",
  "You drench the plowed ground with rain, melting the clods and leveling the ridges. You soften the earth with showers and bless its abundant crops.",
  "You crown the year with a bountiful harvest; even the hard pathways overflow with abundance.",
  "The grasslands of the wilderness become a lush pasture, and the hillsides blossom with joy.",
  "The meadows are clothed with flocks of sheep, and the valleys are carpeted with grain. They all shout and sing for joy!"
