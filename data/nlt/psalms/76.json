  "God is honored in Judah; his name is great in Israel.",
  "Jerusalem is where he lives; Mount Zion is his home.",
  "There he has broken the fiery arrows of the enemy, the shields and swords and weapons of war. Interlude",
  "You are glorious and more majestic than the everlasting mountains.",
  "Our boldest enemies have been plundered. They lie before us in the sleep of death. No warrior could lift a hand against us.",
  "At the blast of your breath, O God of Jacob, their horses and chariots lay still.",
  "No wonder you are greatly feared! Who can stand before you when your anger explodes?",
  "From heaven you sentenced your enemies; the earth trembled and stood silent before you.",
  "You stand up to judge those who do evil, O God, and to rescue the oppressed of the earth. Interlude",
  "Human defiance only enhances your glory, for you use it as a weapon.",
  "Make vows to the Lord your God, and keep them. Let everyone bring tribute to the Awesome One.",
  "For he breaks the pride of princes, and the kings of the earth fear him."
