  "The Lord is king! Let the nations tremble! He sits on his throne between the cherubim. Let the whole earth quake!",
  "The Lord sits in majesty in Jerusalem, exalted above all the nations.",
  "Let them praise your great and awesome name. Your name is holy!",
  "Mighty King, lover of justice, you have established fairness. You have acted with justice and righteousness throughout Israel.",
  "Exalt the Lord our God! Bow low before his feet, for he is holy!",
  "Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel also called on his name. They cried to the Lord for help, and he answered them.",
  "He spoke to Israel from the pillar of cloud, and they followed the laws and decrees he gave them.",
  "O Lord our God, you answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, but you punished them when they went wrong.",
  "Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain in Jerusalem, for the Lord our God is holy!"
