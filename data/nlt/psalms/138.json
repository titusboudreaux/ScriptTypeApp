  "I give you thanks, O Lord, with all my heart; I will sing your praises before the gods.",
  "I bow before your holy Temple as I worship. I praise your name for your unfailing love and faithfulness; for your promises are backed by all the honor of your name.",
  "As soon as I pray, you answer me; you encourage me by giving me strength.",
  "Every king in all the earth will thank you, Lord, for all of them will hear your words.",
  "Yes, they will sing about the Lord’s ways, for the glory of the Lord is very great.",
  "Though the Lord is great, he cares for the humble, but he keeps his distance from the proud.",
  "Though I am surrounded by troubles, you will protect me from the anger of my enemies. You reach out your hand, and the power of your right hand saves me.",
  "The Lord will work out his plans for my life— for your faithful love, O Lord, endures forever. Don’t abandon me, for you made me."
