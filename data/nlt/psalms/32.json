  "Oh, what joy for those whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sin is put out of sight!",
  "Yes, what joy for those whose record the Lord has cleared of guilt, whose lives are lived in complete honesty!",
  "When I refused to confess my sin, my body wasted away, and I groaned all day long.",
  "Day and night your hand of discipline was heavy on me. My strength evaporated like water in the summer heat. Interlude",
  "Finally, I confessed all my sins to you and stopped trying to hide my guilt. I said to myself, “I will confess my rebellion to the Lord.” And you forgave me! All my guilt is gone. Interlude",
  "Therefore, let all the godly pray to you while there is still time, that they may not drown in the floodwaters of judgment.",
  "For you are my hiding place; you protect me from trouble. You surround me with songs of victory. Interlude",
  "The Lord says, “I will guide you along the best pathway for your life. I will advise you and watch over you.",
  "Do not be like a senseless horse or mule that needs a bit and bridle to keep it under control.”",
  "Many sorrows come to the wicked, but unfailing love surrounds those who trust the Lord.",
  "So rejoice in the Lord and be glad, all you who obey him! Shout for joy, all you whose hearts are pure!"
