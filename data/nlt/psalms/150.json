  "Praise the Lord! Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heaven!",
  "Praise him for his mighty works; praise his unequaled greatness!",
  "Praise him with a blast of the ram’s horn; praise him with the lyre and harp!",
  "Praise him with the tambourine and dancing; praise him with strings and flutes!",
  "Praise him with a clash of cymbals; praise him with loud clanging cymbals.",
  "Let everything that breathes sing praises to the Lord! Praise the Lord!"
