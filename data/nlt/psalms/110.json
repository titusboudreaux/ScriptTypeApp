  "The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit in the place of honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet.”",
  "The Lord will extend your powerful kingdom from Jerusalem; you will rule over your enemies.",
  "When you go to war, your people will serve you willingly. You are arrayed in holy garments, and your strength will be renewed each day like the morning dew.",
  "The Lord has taken an oath and will not break his vow: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”",
  "The Lord stands at your right hand to protect you. He will strike down many kings when his anger erupts.",
  "He will punish the nations and fill their lands with corpses; he will shatter heads over the whole earth.",
  "But he himself will be refreshed from brooks along the way. He will be victorious."
