  "I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the Lord.”",
  "And now here we are, standing inside your gates, O Jerusalem.",
  "Jerusalem is a well-built city; its seamless walls cannot be breached.",
  "All the tribes of Israel—the Lord’s people— make their pilgrimage here. They come to give thanks to the name of the Lord, as the law requires of Israel.",
  "Here stand the thrones where judgment is given, the thrones of the dynasty of David.",
  "Pray for peace in Jerusalem. May all who love this city prosper.",
  "O Jerusalem, may there be peace within your walls and prosperity in your palaces.",
  "For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, “May you have peace.”",
  "For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek what is best for you, O Jerusalem."
