  "Declare me innocent, O Lord, for I have acted with integrity; I have trusted in the Lord without wavering.",
  "Put me on trial, Lord, and cross-examine me. Test my motives and my heart.",
  "For I am always aware of your unfailing love, and I have lived according to your truth.",
  "I do not spend time with liars or go along with hypocrites.",
  "I hate the gatherings of those who do evil, and I refuse to join in with the wicked.",
  "I wash my hands to declare my innocence. I come to your altar, O Lord,",
  "singing a song of thanksgiving and telling of all your wonders.",
  "I love your sanctuary, Lord, the place where your glorious presence dwells.",
  "Don’t let me suffer the fate of sinners. Don’t condemn me along with murderers.",
  "Their hands are dirty with evil schemes, and they constantly take bribes.",
  "But I am not like that; I live with integrity. So redeem me and show me mercy.",
  "Now I stand on solid ground, and I will publicly praise the Lord."
