  "From the depths of despair, O Lord, I call for your help.",
  "Hear my cry, O Lord. Pay attention to my prayer.",
  "Lord, if you kept a record of our sins, who, O Lord, could ever survive?",
  "But you offer forgiveness, that we might learn to fear you.",
  "I am counting on the Lord; yes, I am counting on him. I have put my hope in his word.",
  "I long for the Lord more than sentries long for the dawn, yes, more than sentries long for the dawn.",
  "O Israel, hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is unfailing love. His redemption overflows.",
  "He himself will redeem Israel from every kind of sin."
