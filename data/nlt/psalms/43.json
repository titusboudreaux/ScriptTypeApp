  "Declare me innocent, O God! Defend me against these ungodly people. Rescue me from these unjust liars.",
  "For you are God, my only safe haven. Why have you tossed me aside? Why must I wander around in grief, oppressed by my enemies?",
  "Send out your light and your truth; let them guide me. Let them lead me to your holy mountain, to the place where you live.",
  "There I will go to the altar of God, to God—the source of all my joy. I will praise you with my harp, O God, my God!",
  "Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again— my Savior and my God!"
