  "Praise the Lord! Yes, give praise, O servants of the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord!",
  "Blessed be the name of the Lord now and forever.",
  "Everywhere—from east to west— praise the name of the Lord.",
  "For the Lord is high above the nations; his glory is higher than the heavens.",
  "Who can be compared with the Lord our God, who is enthroned on high?",
  "He stoops to look down on heaven and on earth.",
  "He lifts the poor from the dust and the needy from the garbage dump.",
  "He sets them among princes, even the princes of his own people!",
  "He gives the childless woman a family, making her a happy mother. Praise the Lord!"
