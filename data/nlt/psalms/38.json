  "O Lord, don’t rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your rage!",
  "Your arrows have struck deep, and your blows are crushing me.",
  "Because of your anger, my whole body is sick; my health is broken because of my sins.",
  "My guilt overwhelms me— it is a burden too heavy to bear.",
  "My wounds fester and stink because of my foolish sins.",
  "I am bent over and racked with pain. All day long I walk around filled with grief.",
  "A raging fever burns within me, and my health is broken.",
  "I am exhausted and completely crushed. My groans come from an anguished heart.",
  "You know what I long for, Lord; you hear my every sigh.",
  "My heart beats wildly, my strength fails, and I am going blind.",
  "My loved ones and friends stay away, fearing my disease. Even my own family stands at a distance.",
  "Meanwhile, my enemies lay traps to kill me. Those who wish me harm make plans to ruin me. All day long they plan their treachery.",
  "But I am deaf to all their threats. I am silent before them as one who cannot speak.",
  "I choose to hear nothing, and I make no reply.",
  "For I am waiting for you, O Lord. You must answer for me, O Lord my God.",
  "I prayed, “Don’t let my enemies gloat over me or rejoice at my downfall.”",
  "I am on the verge of collapse, facing constant pain.",
  "But I confess my sins; I am deeply sorry for what I have done.",
  "I have many aggressive enemies; they hate me without reason.",
  "They repay me evil for good and oppose me for pursuing good.",
  "Do not abandon me, O Lord. Do not stand at a distance, my God.",
  "Come quickly to help me, O Lord my savior."
