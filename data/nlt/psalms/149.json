  "Praise the Lord! Sing to the Lord a new song. Sing his praises in the assembly of the faithful.",
  "O Israel, rejoice in your Maker. O people of Jerusalem, exult in your King.",
  "Praise his name with dancing, accompanied by tambourine and harp.",
  "For the Lord delights in his people; he crowns the humble with victory.",
  "Let the faithful rejoice that he honors them. Let them sing for joy as they lie on their beds.",
  "Let the praises of God be in their mouths, and a sharp sword in their hands—",
  "to execute vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,",
  "to bind their kings with shackles and their leaders with iron chains,",
  "to execute the judgment written against them. This is the glorious privilege of his faithful ones. Praise the Lord!"
