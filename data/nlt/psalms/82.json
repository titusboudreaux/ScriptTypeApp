[
  "God presides over heaven’s court; he pronounces judgment on the heavenly beings:",
  "“How long will you hand down unjust decisions by favoring the wicked? Interlude",
  "“Give justice to the poor and the orphan; uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute.",
  "Rescue the poor and helpless; deliver them from the grasp of evil people.",
  "But these oppressors know nothing; they are so ignorant! They wander about in darkness, while the whole world is shaken to the core.",
  "I say, ‘You are gods; you are all children of the Most High.",
  "But you will die like mere mortals and fall like every other ruler.’”",
  "Rise up, O God, and judge the earth, for all the nations belong to you."
