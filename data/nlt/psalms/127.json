  "Unless the Lord builds a house, the work of the builders is wasted. Unless the Lord protects a city, guarding it with sentries will do no good.",
  "It is useless for you to work so hard from early morning until late at night, anxiously working for food to eat; for God gives rest to his loved ones.",
  "Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him.",
  "Children born to a young man are like arrows in a warrior’s hands.",
  "How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them! He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates."
