  "The heavens proclaim the glory of God. The skies display his craftsmanship.",
  "Day after day they continue to speak; night after night they make him known.",
  "They speak without a sound or word; their voice is never heard.",
  "Yet their message has gone throughout the earth, and their words to all the world. God has made a home in the heavens for the sun.",
  "It bursts forth like a radiant bridegroom after his wedding. It rejoices like a great athlete eager to run the race.",
  "The sun rises at one end of the heavens and follows its course to the other end. Nothing can hide from its heat.",
  "The instructions of the Lord are perfect, reviving the soul. The decrees of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.",
  "The commandments of the Lord are right, bringing joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are clear, giving insight for living.",
  "Reverence for the Lord is pure, lasting forever. The laws of the Lord are true; each one is fair.",
  "They are more desirable than gold, even the finest gold. They are sweeter than honey, even honey dripping from the comb.",
  "They are a warning to your servant, a great reward for those who obey them.",
  "How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart? Cleanse me from these hidden faults.",
  "Keep your servant from deliberate sins! Don’t let them control me. Then I will be free of guilt and innocent of great sin.",
  "May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to you, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer."
