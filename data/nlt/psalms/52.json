  "Why do you boast about your crimes, great warrior? Don’t you realize God’s justice continues forever?",
  "All day long you plot destruction. Your tongue cuts like a sharp razor; you’re an expert at telling lies.",
  "You love evil more than good and lies more than truth. Interlude",
  "You love to destroy others with your words, you liar!",
  "But God will strike you down once and for all. He will pull you from your home and uproot you from the land of the living. Interlude",
  "The righteous will see it and be amazed. They will laugh and say,",
  "“Look what happens to mighty warriors who do not trust in God. They trust their wealth instead and grow more and more bold in their wickedness.”",
  "But I am like an olive tree, thriving in the house of God. I will always trust in God’s unfailing love.",
  "I will praise you forever, O God, for what you have done. I will trust in your good name in the presence of your faithful people."
