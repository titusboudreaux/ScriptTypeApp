  "How the king rejoices in your strength, O Lord! He shouts with joy because you give him victory.",
  "For you have given him his heart’s desire; you have withheld nothing he requested. Interlude",
  "You welcomed him back with success and prosperity. You placed a crown of finest gold on his head.",
  "He asked you to preserve his life, and you granted his request. The days of his life stretch on forever.",
  "Your victory brings him great honor, and you have clothed him with splendor and majesty.",
  "You have endowed him with eternal blessings and given him the joy of your presence.",
  "For the king trusts in the Lord. The unfailing love of the Most High will keep him from stumbling.",
  "You will capture all your enemies. Your strong right hand will seize all who hate you.",
  "You will throw them in a flaming furnace when you appear. The Lord will consume them in his anger; fire will devour them.",
  "You will wipe their children from the face of the earth; they will never have descendants.",
  "Although they plot against you, their evil schemes will never succeed.",
  "For they will turn and run when they see your arrows aimed at them.",
  "Rise up, O Lord, in all your power. With music and singing we celebrate your mighty acts."
