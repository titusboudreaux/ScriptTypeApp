  "Answer me when I call to you, O God who declares me innocent. Free me from my troubles. Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.",
  "How long will you people ruin my reputation? How long will you make groundless accusations? How long will you continue your lies? Interlude",
  "You can be sure of this: The Lord set apart the godly for himself. The Lord will answer when I call to him.",
  "Don’t sin by letting anger control you. Think about it overnight and remain silent. Interlude",
  "Offer sacrifices in the right spirit, and trust the Lord.",
  "Many people say, “Who will show us better times?” Let your face smile on us, Lord.",
  "You have given me greater joy than those who have abundant harvests of grain and new wine.",
  "In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, O Lord, will keep me safe."
