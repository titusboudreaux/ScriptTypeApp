  "O Lord, how long will you forget me? Forever? How long will you look the other way?",
  "How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul, with sorrow in my heart every day? How long will my enemy have the upper hand?",
  "Turn and answer me, O Lord my God! Restore the sparkle to my eyes, or I will die.",
  "Don’t let my enemies gloat, saying, “We have defeated him!” Don’t let them rejoice at my downfall.",
  "But I trust in your unfailing love. I will rejoice because you have rescued me.",
  "I will sing to the Lord because he is good to me."
