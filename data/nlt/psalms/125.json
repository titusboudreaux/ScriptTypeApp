  "Those who trust in the Lord are as secure as Mount Zion; they will not be defeated but will endure forever.",
  "Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people, both now and forever.",
  "The wicked will not rule the land of the godly, for then the godly might be tempted to do wrong.",
  "O Lord, do good to those who are good, whose hearts are in tune with you.",
  "But banish those who turn to crooked ways, O Lord. Take them away with those who do evil. May Israel have peace!"
