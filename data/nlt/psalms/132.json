  "Lord, remember David and all that he suffered.",
  "He made a solemn promise to the Lord. He vowed to the Mighty One of Israel,",
  "“I will not go home; I will not let myself rest.",
  "I will not let my eyes sleep nor close my eyelids in slumber",
  "until I find a place to build a house for the Lord, a sanctuary for the Mighty One of Israel.”",
  "We heard that the Ark was in Ephrathah; then we found it in the distant countryside of Jaar.",
  "Let us go to the sanctuary of the Lord; let us worship at the footstool of his throne.",
  "Arise, O Lord, and enter your resting place, along with the Ark, the symbol of your power.",
  "May your priests be clothed in godliness; may your loyal servants sing for joy.",
  "For the sake of your servant David, do not reject the king you have anointed.",
  "The Lord swore an oath to David with a promise he will never take back: “I will place one of your descendants on your throne.",
  "If your descendants obey the terms of my covenant and the laws that I teach them, then your royal line will continue forever and ever.”",
  "For the Lord has chosen Jerusalem; he has desired it for his home.",
  "“This is my resting place forever,” he said. “I will live here, for this is the home I desired.",
  "I will bless this city and make it prosperous; I will satisfy its poor with food.",
  "I will clothe its priests with godliness; its faithful servants will sing for joy.",
  "Here I will increase the power of David; my anointed one will be a light for my people.",
  "I will clothe his enemies with shame, but he will be a glorious king.”"
