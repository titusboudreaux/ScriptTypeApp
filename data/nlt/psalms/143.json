  "Hear my prayer, O Lord; listen to my plea! Answer me because you are faithful and righteous.",
  "Don’t put your servant on trial, for no one is innocent before you.",
  "My enemy has chased me. He has knocked me to the ground and forces me to live in darkness like those in the grave.",
  "I am losing all hope; I am paralyzed with fear.",
  "I remember the days of old. I ponder all your great works and think about what you have done.",
  "I lift my hands to you in prayer. I thirst for you as parched land thirsts for rain. Interlude",
  "Come quickly, Lord, and answer me, for my depression deepens. Don’t turn away from me, or I will die.",
  "Let me hear of your unfailing love each morning, for I am trusting you. Show me where to walk, for I give myself to you.",
  "Rescue me from my enemies, Lord; I run to you to hide me.",
  "Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. May your gracious Spirit lead me forward on a firm footing.",
  "For the glory of your name, O Lord, preserve my life. Because of your faithfulness, bring me out of this distress.",
  "In your unfailing love, silence all my enemies and destroy all my foes, for I am your servant."
