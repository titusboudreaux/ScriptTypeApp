  "O God, listen to my cry! Hear my prayer!",
  "From the ends of the earth, I cry to you for help when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the towering rock of safety,",
  "for you are my safe refuge, a fortress where my enemies cannot reach me.",
  "Let me live forever in your sanctuary, safe beneath the shelter of your wings! Interlude",
  "For you have heard my vows, O God. You have given me an inheritance reserved for those who fear your name.",
  "Add many years to the life of the king! May his years span the generations!",
  "May he reign under God’s protection forever. May your unfailing love and faithfulness watch over him.",
  "Then I will sing praises to your name forever as I fulfill my vows each day."
