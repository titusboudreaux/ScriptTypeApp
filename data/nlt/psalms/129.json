  "From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me. Let all Israel repeat this:",
  "From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me, but they have never defeated me.",
  "My back is covered with cuts, as if a farmer had plowed long furrows.",
  "But the Lord is good; he has cut me free from the ropes of the ungodly.",
  "May all who hate Jerusalem be turned back in shameful defeat.",
  "May they be as useless as grass on a rooftop, turning yellow when only half grown,",
  "ignored by the harvester, despised by the binder.",
  "And may those who pass by refuse to give them this blessing: “The Lord bless you; we bless you in the Lord’s name.”"
