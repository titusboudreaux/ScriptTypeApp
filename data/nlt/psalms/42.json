  "As the deer longs for streams of water, so I long for you, O God.",
  "I thirst for God, the living God. When can I go and stand before him?",
  "Day and night I have only tears for food, while my enemies continually taunt me, saying, “Where is this God of yours?”",
  "My heart is breaking as I remember how it used to be: I walked among the crowds of worshipers, leading a great procession to the house of God, singing for joy and giving thanks amid the sound of a great celebration!",
  "Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again— my Savior and",
  "my God! Now I am deeply discouraged, but I will remember you— even from distant Mount Hermon, the source of the Jordan, from the land of Mount Mizar.",
  "I hear the tumult of the raging seas as your waves and surging tides sweep over me.",

  "“O God my rock,” I cry, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I wander around in grief, oppressed by my enemies?”",
  "Their taunts break my bones. They scoff, “Where is this God of yours?”",
  "Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again— my Savior and my God!"
