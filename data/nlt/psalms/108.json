  "My heart is confident in you, O God; no wonder I can sing your praises with all my heart!",
  "Wake up, lyre and harp! I will wake the dawn with my song.",
  "I will thank you, Lord, among all the people. I will sing your praises among the nations.",
  "For your unfailing love is higher than the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.",
  "Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens. May your glory shine over all the earth.",
  "Now rescue your beloved people. Answer and save us by your power.",
  "God has promised this by his holiness: “I will divide up Shechem with joy. I will measure out the valley of Succoth.",
  "Gilead is mine, and Manasseh, too. Ephraim, my helmet, will produce my warriors, and Judah, my scepter, will produce my kings.",
  "But Moab, my washbasin, will become my servant, and I will wipe my feet on Edom and shout in triumph over Philistia.”",
  "Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will bring me victory over Edom?",
  "Have you rejected us, O God? Will you no longer march with our armies?",
  "Oh, please help us against our enemies, for all human help is useless.",
  "With God’s help we will do mighty things, for he will trample down our foes."
