  "O God, you are my God; I earnestly search for you. My soul thirsts for you; my whole body longs for you in this parched and weary land where there is no water.",
  "I have seen you in your sanctuary and gazed upon your power and glory.",
  "Your unfailing love is better than life itself; how I praise you!",
  "I will praise you as long as I live, lifting up my hands to you in prayer.",
  "You satisfy me more than the richest feast. I will praise you with songs of joy.",
  "I lie awake thinking of you, meditating on you through the night.",
  "Because you are my helper, I sing for joy in the shadow of your wings.",
  "I cling to you; your strong right hand holds me securely.",
  "But those plotting to destroy me will come to ruin. They will go down into the depths of the earth.",
  "They will die by the sword and become the food of jackals.",
  "But the king will rejoice in God. All who swear to tell the truth will praise him, while liars will be silenced."
