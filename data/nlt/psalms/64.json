  "O God, listen to my complaint. Protect my life from my enemies’ threats.",
  "Hide me from the plots of this evil mob, from this gang of wrongdoers.",
  "They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their bitter words like arrows.",
  "They shoot from ambush at the innocent, attacking suddenly and fearlessly.",
  "They encourage each other to do evil and plan how to set their traps in secret. “Who will ever notice?” they ask.",
  "As they plot their crimes, they say, “We have devised the perfect plan!” Yes, the human heart and mind are cunning.",
  "But God himself will shoot them with his arrows, suddenly striking them down.",
  "Their own tongues will ruin them, and all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.",
  "Then everyone will be afraid; they will proclaim the mighty acts of God and realize all the amazing things he does.",
  "The godly will rejoice in the Lord and find shelter in him. And those who do what is right will praise him."
