[
  "Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers.",
  "But they delight in the law of the Lord, meditating on it day and night.",
  "They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season. Their leaves never wither, and they prosper in all they do.",
  "But not the wicked! They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind.",
  "They will be condemned at the time of judgment. Sinners will have no place among the godly.",
  "For the Lord watches over the path of the godly, but the path of the wicked leads to destruction."
