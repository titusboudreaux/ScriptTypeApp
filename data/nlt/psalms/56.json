  "O God, have mercy on me, for people are hounding me. My foes attack me all day long.",
  "I am constantly hounded by those who slander me, and many are boldly attacking me.",
  "But when I am afraid, I will put my trust in you.",
  "I praise God for what he has promised. I trust in God, so why should I be afraid? What can mere mortals do to me?",
  "They are always twisting what I say; they spend their days plotting to harm me.",
  "They come together to spy on me— watching my every step, eager to kill me.",
  "Don’t let them get away with their wickedness; in your anger, O God, bring them down.",
  "You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.",
  "My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help. This I know: God is on my side!",
  "I praise God for what he has promised; yes, I praise the Lord for what he has promised.",
  "I trust in God, so why should I be afraid? What can mere mortals do to me?",
  "I will fulfill my vows to you, O God, and will offer a sacrifice of thanks for your help.",
  "For you have rescued me from death; you have kept my feet from slipping. So now I can walk in your presence, O God, in your life-giving light."
