[
  "Come, let us sing to the Lord! Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation.",
  "Let us come to him with thanksgiving. Let us sing psalms of praise to him.",
  "For the Lord is a great God, a great King above all gods.",
  "He holds in his hands the depths of the earth and the mightiest mountains.",
  "The sea belongs to him, for he made it. His hands formed the dry land, too.",
  "Come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before the Lord our maker,",
  "for he is our God. We are the people he watches over, the flock under his care. If only you would listen to his voice today!",
  "The Lord says, “Don’t harden your hearts as Israel did at Meribah, as they did at Massah in the wilderness.",
  "For there your ancestors tested and tried my patience, even though they saw everything I did.",
  "For forty years I was angry with them, and I said, ‘They are a people whose hearts turn away from me. They refuse to do what I tell them.’",
  "So in my anger I took an oath: ‘They will never enter my place of rest.’”"
