  "What if the Lord had not been on our side? Let all Israel repeat:",
  "What if the Lord had not been on our side when people attacked us?",
  "They would have swallowed us alive in their burning anger.",
  "The waters would have engulfed us; a torrent would have overwhelmed us.",
  "Yes, the raging waters of their fury would have overwhelmed our very lives.",
  "Praise the Lord, who did not let their teeth tear us apart!",
  "We escaped like a bird from a hunter’s trap. The trap is broken, and we are free!",
  "Our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth."
