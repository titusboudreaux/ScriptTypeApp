  "I look up to the mountains— does my help come from there?",
  "My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth!",
  "He will not let you stumble; the one who watches over you will not slumber.",
  "Indeed, he who watches over Israel never slumbers or sleeps.",
  "The Lord himself watches over you! The Lord stands beside you as your protective shade.",
  "The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon at night.",
  "The Lord keeps you from all harm and watches over your life.",
  "The Lord keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever."
