  "I said to myself, “I will watch what I do and not sin in what I say. I will hold my tongue when the ungodly are around me.”",
  "But as I stood there in silence— not even speaking of good things— the turmoil within me grew worse.",
  "The more I thought about it, the hotter I got, igniting a fire of words:",
  "“Lord, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered— how fleeting my life is.",
  "You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. My entire lifetime is just a moment to you; at best, each of us is but a breath.” Interlude",
  "We are merely moving shadows, and all our busy rushing ends in nothing. We heap up wealth, not knowing who will spend it.",
  "And so, Lord, where do I put my hope? My only hope is in you.",
  "Rescue me from my rebellion. Do not let fools mock me.",
  "I am silent before you; I won’t say a word, for my punishment is from you.",
  "But please stop striking me! I am exhausted by the blows from your hand.",
  "When you discipline us for our sins, you consume like a moth what is precious to us. Each of us is but a breath. Interlude",
  "Hear my prayer, O Lord! Listen to my cries for help! Don’t ignore my tears. For I am your guest— a traveler passing through, as my ancestors were before me.",
  "Leave me alone so I can smile again before I am gone and exist no more."
