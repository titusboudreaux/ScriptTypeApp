  "Sing a new song to the Lord, for he has done wonderful deeds. His right hand has won a mighty victory; his holy arm has shown his saving power!",
  "The Lord has announced his victory and has revealed his righteousness to every nation!",
  "He has remembered his promise to love and be faithful to Israel. The ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.",
  "Shout to the Lord, all the earth; break out in praise and sing for joy!",
  "Sing your praise to the Lord with the harp, with the harp and melodious song,",
  "with trumpets and the sound of the ram’s horn. Make a joyful symphony before the Lord, the King!",
  "Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise! Let the earth and all living things join in.",
  "Let the rivers clap their hands in glee! Let the hills sing out their songs of joy",
  "before the Lord, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice, and the nations with fairness."
