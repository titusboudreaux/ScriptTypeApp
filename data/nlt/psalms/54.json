  "Come with great power, O God, and rescue me! Defend me with your might.",
  "Listen to my prayer, O God. Pay attention to my plea.",
  "For strangers are attacking me; violent people are trying to kill me. They care nothing for God. Interlude",
  "But God is my helper. The Lord keeps me alive!",
  "May the evil plans of my enemies be turned against them. Do as you promised and put an end to them.",
  "I will sacrifice a voluntary offering to you; I will praise your name, O Lord, for it is good.",
  "For you have rescued me from my troubles and helped me to triumph over my enemies."
