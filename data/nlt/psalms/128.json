  "How joyful are those who fear the Lord— all who follow his ways!",
  "You will enjoy the fruit of your labor. How joyful and prosperous you will be!",
  "Your wife will be like a fruitful grapevine, flourishing within your home. Your children will be like vigorous young olive trees as they sit around your table.",
  "That is the Lord’s blessing for those who fear him.",
  "May the Lord continually bless you from Zion. May you see Jerusalem prosper as long as you live.",
  "May you live to enjoy your grandchildren. May Israel have peace!"
