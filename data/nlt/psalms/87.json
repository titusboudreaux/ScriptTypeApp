  "On the holy mountain stands the city founded by the Lord.",
  "He loves the city of Jerusalem more than any other city in Israel.",
  "O city of God, what glorious things are said of you! Interlude",
  "I will count Egypt and Babylon among those who know me— also Philistia and Tyre, and even distant Ethiopia. They have all become citizens of Jerusalem!",
  "Regarding Jerusalem it will be said, “Everyone enjoys the rights of citizenship there.” And the Most High will personally bless this city.",
  "When the Lord registers the nations, he will say, “They have all become citizens of Jerusalem.” Interlude",
  "The people will play flutes and sing, “The source of my life springs from Jerusalem!”"
