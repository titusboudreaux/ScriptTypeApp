  "Why are the nations so angry? Why do they waste their time with futile plans?",
  "The kings of the earth prepare for battle; the rulers plot together against the Lord and against his anointed one.",
  "“Let us break their chains,” they cry, “and free ourselves from slavery to God.”",
  "But the one who rules in heaven laughs. The Lord scoffs at them.",
  "Then in anger he rebukes them, terrifying them with his fierce fury.",
  "For the Lord declares, “I have placed my chosen king on the throne in Jerusalem, on my holy mountain.”",
  "The king proclaims the Lord’s decree: “The Lord said to me, ‘You are my son. Today I have become your Father.",
  "Only ask, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, the whole earth as your possession.",
  "You will break them with an iron rod and smash them like clay pots.’”",
  "Now then, you kings, act wisely! Be warned, you rulers of the earth!",
  "Serve the Lord with reverent fear, and rejoice with trembling.",
  "Submit to God’s royal son, or he will become angry, and you will be destroyed in the midst of all your activities— for his anger flares up in an instant. But what joy for all who take refuge in him!"
