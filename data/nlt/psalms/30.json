  "I will exalt you, Lord, for you rescued me. You refused to let my enemies triumph over me.",
  "O Lord my God, I cried to you for help, and you restored my health.",
  "You brought me up from the grave, O Lord. You kept me from falling into the pit of death.",
  "Sing to the Lord, all you godly ones! Praise his holy name.",
  "For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime! Weeping may last through the night, but joy comes with the morning.",
  "When I was prosperous, I said, “Nothing can stop me now!”",
  "Your favor, O Lord, made me as secure as a mountain. Then you turned away from me, and I was shattered.",
  "I cried out to you, O Lord. I begged the Lord for mercy, saying,",
  "“What will you gain if I die, if I sink into the grave? Can my dust praise you? Can it tell of your faithfulness?",
  "Hear me, Lord, and have mercy on me. Help me, O Lord.”",
  "You have turned my mourning into joyful dancing. You have taken away my clothes of mourning and clothed me with joy,",
  "that I might sing praises to you and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give you thanks forever!"
