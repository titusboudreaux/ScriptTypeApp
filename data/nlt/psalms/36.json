  "Sin whispers to the wicked, deep within their hearts. They have no fear of God at all.",
  "In their blind conceit, they cannot see how wicked they really are.",
  "Everything they say is crooked and deceitful. They refuse to act wisely or do good.",
  "They lie awake at night, hatching sinful plots. Their actions are never good. They make no attempt to turn from evil.",
  "Your unfailing love, O Lord, is as vast as the heavens; your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds.",
  "Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the ocean depths. You care for people and animals alike, O Lord.",
  "How precious is your unfailing love, O God! All humanity finds shelter in the shadow of your wings.",
  "You feed them from the abundance of your own house, letting them drink from your river of delights.",
  "For you are the fountain of life, the light by which we see.",
  "Pour out your unfailing love on those who love you; give justice to those with honest hearts.",
  "Don’t let the proud trample me or the wicked push me around.",
  "Look! Those who do evil have fallen! They are thrown down, never to rise again."
