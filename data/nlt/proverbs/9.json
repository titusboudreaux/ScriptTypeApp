  "Wisdom has built her house; she has carved its seven columns.",
  "She has prepared a great banquet, mixed the wines, and set the table.",
  "She has sent her servants to invite everyone to come. She calls out from the heights overlooking the city.",
  "“Come in with me,” she urges the simple. To those who lack good judgment, she says,",
  "“Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed.",
  "Leave your simple ways behind, and begin to live; learn to use good judgment.”",
  "Anyone who rebukes a mocker will get an insult in return. Anyone who corrects the wicked will get hurt.",
  "So don’t bother correcting mockers; they will only hate you. But correct the wise, and they will love you.",
  "Instruct the wise, and they will be even wiser. Teach the righteous, and they will learn even more.",
  "Fear of the Lord is the foundation of wisdom. Knowledge of the Holy One results in good judgment.",
  "Wisdom will multiply your days and add years to your life.",
  "If you become wise, you will be the one to benefit. If you scorn wisdom, you will be the one to suffer.",
  "The woman named Folly is brash. She is ignorant and doesn’t know it.",
  "She sits in her doorway on the heights overlooking the city.",
  "She calls out to men going by who are minding their own business.",
  "“Come in with me,” she urges the simple. To those who lack good judgment, she says,",
  "“Stolen water is refreshing; food eaten in secret tastes the best!”",
  "But little do they know that the dead are there. Her guests are in the depths of the grave."
