  "Know the state of your flocks, and put your heart into caring for your herds,",
  "for riches don’t last forever, and the crown might not be passed to the next generation.",
  "After the hay is harvested and the new crop appears and the mountain grasses are gathered in,",
  "your sheep will provide wool for clothing, and your goats will provide the price of a field.",
  "And you will have enough goats’ milk for yourself, your family, and your servant girls."
