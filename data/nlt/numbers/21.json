  "The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that the Israelites were approaching on the road through Atharim. So he attacked the Israelites and took some of them as prisoners.",
  "Then the people of Israel made this vow to the Lord: “If you will hand these people over to us, we will completely destroy all their towns.”",
  "The Lord heard the Israelites’ request and gave them victory over the Canaanites. The Israelites completely destroyed them and their towns, and the place has been called Hormah ever since.",
  "Then the people of Israel set out from Mount Hor, taking the road to the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient with the long journey,",
  "and they began to speak against God and Moses. “Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in the wilderness?” they complained. “There is nothing to eat here and nothing to drink. And we hate this horrible manna!”",
  "So the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the people, and many were bitten and died.",
  "Then the people came to Moses and cried out, “We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take away the snakes.” So Moses prayed for the people.",
  "Then the Lord told him, “Make a replica of a poisonous snake and attach it to a pole. All who are bitten will live if they simply look at it!”",
  "So Moses made a snake out of bronze and attached it to a pole. Then anyone who was bitten by a snake could look at the bronze snake and be healed!",
  "The Israelites traveled next to Oboth and camped there.",
  "Then they went on to Iye-abarim, in the wilderness on the eastern border of Moab.",
  "From there they traveled to the valley of Zered Brook and set up camp.",
  "Then they moved out and camped on the far side of the Arnon River, in the wilderness adjacent to the territory of the Amorites. The Arnon is the boundary line between the Moabites and the Amorites.",
  "For this reason The Book of the Wars of the Lord speaks of “the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the ravines of the Arnon River,",
  "and the ravines that extend as far as the settlement of Ar on the border of Moab.”",
  "From there the Israelites traveled to Beer, which is the well where the Lord said to Moses, “Assemble the people, and I will give them water.”",
  "There the Israelites sang this song: “Spring up, O well! Yes, sing its praises!",
  "Sing of this well, which princes dug, which great leaders hollowed out with their scepters and staffs.” Then the Israelites left the wilderness and proceeded on through Mattanah,",
  "Nahaliel, and Bamoth.",
  "After that they went to the valley in Moab where Pisgah Peak overlooks the wasteland.",
  "The Israelites sent ambassadors to King Sihon of the Amorites with this message:",
  "“Let us travel through your land. We will be careful not to go through your fields and vineyards. We won’t even drink water from your wells. We will stay on the king’s road until we have passed through your territory.”",
  "But King Sihon refused to let them cross his territory. Instead, he mobilized his entire army and attacked Israel in the wilderness, engaging them in battle at Jahaz.",
  "But the Israelites slaughtered them with their swords and occupied their land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River. They went only as far as the Ammonite border because the boundary of the Ammonites was fortified.",
  "So Israel captured all the towns of the Amorites and settled in them, including the city of Heshbon and its surrounding villages.",
  "Heshbon had been the capital of King Sihon of the Amorites. He had defeated a former Moabite king and seized all his land as far as the Arnon River.",
  "Therefore, the ancient poets wrote this about him: “Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt! Let the city of Sihon be restored.",
  "A fire flamed forth from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It burned the city of Ar in Moab; it destroyed the rulers of the Arnon heights.",
  "What sorrow awaits you, O people of Moab! You are finished, O worshipers of Chemosh! Chemosh has left his sons as refugees, his daughters as captives of Sihon, the Amorite king.",
  "We have utterly destroyed them, from Heshbon to Dibon. We have completely wiped them out as far away as Nophah and Medeba.”",
  "So the people of Israel occupied the territory of the Amorites.",
  "After Moses sent men to explore the Jazer area, they captured all the towns in the region and drove out the Amorites who lived there.",
  "Then they turned and marched up the road to Bashan, but King Og of Bashan and all his people attacked them at Edrei.",
  "The Lord said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you, along with all his people and his land. Do the same to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.”",
  "And Israel killed King Og, his sons, and all his subjects; not a single survivor remained. Then Israel occupied their land."
