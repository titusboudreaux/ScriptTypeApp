  "In that day you will sing: “I will praise you, O Lord! You were angry with me, but not any more. Now you comfort me.",
  "See, God has come to save me. I will trust in him and not be afraid. The Lord God is my strength and my song; he has given me victory.”",
  "With joy you will drink deeply from the fountain of salvation!",
  "In that wonderful day you will sing: “Thank the Lord! Praise his name! Tell the nations what he has done. Let them know how mighty he is!",
  "Sing to the Lord, for he has done wonderful things. Make known his praise around the world.",
  "Let all the people of Jerusalem shout his praise with joy! For great is the Holy One of Israel who lives among you.”"
