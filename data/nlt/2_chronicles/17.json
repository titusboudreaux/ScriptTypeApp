  "Then Jehoshaphat, Asa’s son, became the next king. He strengthened Judah to stand against any attack from Israel.",
  "He stationed troops in all the fortified towns of Judah, and he assigned additional garrisons to the land of Judah and to the towns of Ephraim that his father, Asa, had captured.",
  "The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father’s early years and did not worship the images of Baal.",
  "He sought his father’s God and obeyed his commands instead of following the evil practices of the kingdom of Israel.",

  "They took copies of the Book of the Law of the Lord and traveled around through all the towns of Judah, teaching the people.",
  "Then the fear of the Lord fell over all the surrounding kingdoms so that none of them wanted to declare war on Jehoshaphat.",

  "From Benjamin there were 200,000 troops equipped with bows and shields. They were under the command of Eliada, a veteran soldier.",
