  "And now, a word to you who are elders in the churches. I, too, am an elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ. And I, too, will share in his glory when he is revealed to the whole world. As a fellow elder, I appeal to you:",
  "Care for the flock that God has entrusted to you. Watch over it willingly, not grudgingly—not for what you will get out of it, but because you are eager to serve God.",
  "Don’t lord it over the people assigned to your care, but lead them by your own good example.",
  "And when the Great Shepherd appears, you will receive a crown of never-ending glory and honor.",
  "In the same way, you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders. And all of you, dress yourselves in humility as you relate to one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”",
  "So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honor.",
  "Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.",
  "Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.",
  "Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.",
  "In his kindness God called you to share in his eternal glory by means of Christ Jesus. So after you have suffered a little while, he will restore, support, and strengthen you, and he will place you on a firm foundation.",
  "All power to him forever! Amen.",
  "I have written and sent this short letter to you with the help of Silas, whom I commend to you as a faithful brother. My purpose in writing is to encourage you and assure you that what you are experiencing is truly part of God’s grace for you. Stand firm in this grace.",
  "Your sister church here in Babylon sends you greetings, and so does my son Mark.",
  "Greet each other with a kiss of love. Peace be with all of you who are in Christ."
