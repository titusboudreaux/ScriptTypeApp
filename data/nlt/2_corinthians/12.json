  "This boasting will do no good, but I must go on. I will reluctantly tell about visions and revelations from the Lord.",
  "I was caught up to the third heaven fourteen years ago. Whether I was in my body or out of my body, I don’t know—only God knows.",
  "Yes, only God knows whether I was in my body or outside my body. But I do know",
  "that I was caught up to paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be expressed in words, things no human is allowed to tell.",
  "That experience is worth boasting about, but I’m not going to do it. I will boast only about my weaknesses.",
  "If I wanted to boast, I would be no fool in doing so, because I would be telling the truth. But I won’t do it, because I don’t want anyone to give me credit beyond what they can see in my life or hear in my message,",
  "even though I have received such wonderful revelations from God. So to keep me from becoming proud, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud.",
  "Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away.",
  "Each time he said, “My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.” So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me.",
  "That’s why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.",
  "You have made me act like a fool. You ought to be writing commendations for me, for I am not at all inferior to these “super apostles,” even though I am nothing at all.",
  "When I was with you, I certainly gave you proof that I am an apostle. For I patiently did many signs and wonders and miracles among you.",
  "The only thing I failed to do, which I do in the other churches, was to become a financial burden to you. Please forgive me for this wrong!",
  "Now I am coming to you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. I don’t want what you have—I want you. After all, children don’t provide for their parents. Rather, parents provide for their children.",
  "I will gladly spend myself and all I have for you, even though it seems that the more I love you, the less you love me.",
  "Some of you admit I was not a burden to you. But others still think I was sneaky and took advantage of you by trickery.",
  "But how? Did any of the men I sent to you take advantage of you?",
  "When I urged Titus to visit you and sent our other brother with him, did Titus take advantage of you? No! For we have the same spirit and walk in each other’s steps, doing things the same way.",
  "Perhaps you think we’re saying these things just to defend ourselves. No, we tell you this as Christ’s servants, and with God as our witness. Everything we do, dear friends, is to strengthen you.",
  "For I am afraid that when I come I won’t like what I find, and you won’t like my response. I am afraid that I will find quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly behavior.",
  "Yes, I am afraid that when I come again, God will humble me in your presence. And I will be grieved because many of you have not given up your old sins. You have not repented of your impurity, sexual immorality, and eagerness for lustful pleasure."
