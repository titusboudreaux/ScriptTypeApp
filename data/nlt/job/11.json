  "Then Zophar the Naamathite replied to Job:",
  "“Shouldn’t someone answer this torrent of words? Is a person proved innocent just by a lot of talking?",
  "Should I remain silent while you babble on? When you mock God, shouldn’t someone make you ashamed?",
  "You claim, ‘My beliefs are pure,’ and ‘I am clean in the sight of God.’",
  "If only God would speak; if only he would tell you what he thinks!",
  "If only he would tell you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom is not a simple matter. Listen! God is doubtless punishing you far less than you deserve!",
  "“Can you solve the mysteries of God? Can you discover everything about the Almighty?",
  "Such knowledge is higher than the heavens— and who are you? It is deeper than the underworld— what do you know?",
  "It is broader than the earth and wider than the sea.",
  "If God comes and puts a person in prison or calls the court to order, who can stop him?",
  "For he knows those who are false, and he takes note of all their sins.",
  "An empty-headed person won’t become wise any more than a wild donkey can bear a human child.",
  "“If only you would prepare your heart and lift up your hands to him in prayer!",
  "Get rid of your sins, and leave all iniquity behind you.",
  "Then your face will brighten with innocence. You will be strong and free of fear.",
  "You will forget your misery; it will be like water flowing away.",
  "Your life will be brighter than the noonday. Even darkness will be as bright as morning.",
  "Having hope will give you courage. You will be protected and will rest in safety.",
  "You will lie down unafraid, and many will look to you for help.",
  "But the wicked will be blinded. They will have no escape. Their only hope is death.”"
