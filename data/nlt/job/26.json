  "Then Job spoke again:",
  "“How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the weak!",
  "How you have enlightened my stupidity! What wise advice you have offered!",
  "Where have you gotten all these wise sayings? Whose spirit speaks through you?",
  "“The dead tremble— those who live beneath the waters.",
  "The underworld is naked in God’s presence. The place of destruction is uncovered.",
  "God stretches the northern sky over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing.",
  "He wraps the rain in his thick clouds, and the clouds don’t burst with the weight.",
  "He covers the face of the moon, shrouding it with his clouds.",
  "He created the horizon when he separated the waters; he set the boundary between day and night.",
  "The foundations of heaven tremble; they shudder at his rebuke.",
  "By his power the sea grew calm. By his skill he crushed the great sea monster.",
  "His Spirit made the heavens beautiful, and his power pierced the gliding serpent.",
  "These are just the beginning of all that he does, merely a whisper of his power. Who, then, can comprehend the thunder of his power?”"
