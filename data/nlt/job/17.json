  "“My spirit is crushed, and my life is nearly snuffed out. The grave is ready to receive me.",
  "I am surrounded by mockers. I watch how bitterly they taunt me.",
  "“You must defend my innocence, O God, since no one else will stand up for me.",
  "You have closed their minds to understanding, but do not let them triumph.",
  "They betray their friends for their own advantage, so let their children faint with hunger.",
  "“God has made a mockery of me among the people; they spit in my face.",
  "My eyes are swollen with weeping, and I am but a shadow of my former self.",
  "The virtuous are horrified when they see me. The innocent rise up against the ungodly.",
  "The righteous keep moving forward, and those with clean hands become stronger and stronger.",
  "“As for all of you, come back with a better argument, though I still won’t find a wise man among you.",
  "My days are over. My hopes have disappeared. My heart’s desires are broken.",
  "These men say that night is day; they claim that the darkness is light.",
  "What if I go to the grave and make my bed in darkness?",
  "What if I call the grave my father, and the maggot my mother or my sister?",
  "Where then is my hope? Can anyone find it?",
  "No, my hope will go down with me to the grave. We will rest together in the dust!”"
