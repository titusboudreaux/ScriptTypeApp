  "Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:",
  "“God is powerful and dreadful. He enforces peace in the heavens.",
  "Who is able to count his heavenly army? Doesn’t his light shine on all the earth?",
  "How can a mortal be innocent before God? Can anyone born of a woman be pure?",
  "God is more glorious than the moon; he shines brighter than the stars.",
  "In comparison, people are maggots; we mortals are mere worms.”"
