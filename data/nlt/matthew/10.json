  "Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority to cast out evil spirits and to heal every kind of disease and illness.",

  "“Don’t take any money in your money belts—no gold, silver, or even copper coins.",
  "Don’t carry a traveler’s bag with a change of clothes and sandals or even a walking stick. Don’t hesitate to accept hospitality, because those who work deserve to be fed.",
  "“Whenever you enter a city or village, search for a worthy person and stay in his home until you leave town.",
  "When you enter the home, give it your blessing.",
  "If it turns out to be a worthy home, let your blessing stand; if it is not, take back the blessing.",

  "When you are persecuted in one town, flee to the next. I tell you the truth, the Son of Man will return before you have reached all the towns of Israel.",
  "“Students are not greater than their teacher, and slaves are not greater than their master.",
  "Students are to be like their teacher, and slaves are to be like their master. And since I, the master of the household, have been called the prince of demons, the members of my household will be called by even worse names!",
  "“But don’t be afraid of those who threaten you. For the time is coming when everything that is covered will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.",
  "What I tell you now in the darkness, shout abroad when daybreak comes. What I whisper in your ear, shout from the housetops for all to hear!",
  "“Don’t be afraid of those who want to kill your body; they cannot touch your soul. Fear only God, who can destroy both soul and body in hell.",
  "What is the price of two sparrows—one copper coin? But not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.",
  "And the very hairs on your head are all numbered.",

  "If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, you are not worthy of being mine.",
  "If you cling to your life, you will lose it; but if you give up your life for me, you will find it.",
  "“Anyone who receives you receives me, and anyone who receives me receives the Father who sent me.",
  "If you receive a prophet as one who speaks for God, you will be given the same reward as a prophet. And if you receive righteous people because of their righteousness, you will be given a reward like theirs.",
  "And if you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers, you will surely be rewarded.”"
