  "Lord, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me!",
  "Many are saying of me, “God will not deliver him.”",
  "But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high.",
  "I call out to the Lord, and he answers me from his holy mountain.",
  "I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.",
  "I will not fear though tens of thousands assail me on every side.",
  "Arise, Lord! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.",
  "From the Lord comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people."
