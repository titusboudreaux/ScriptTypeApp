  "Truly my soul finds rest in God; my salvation comes from him.",
  "Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.",
  "How long will you assault me? Would all of you throw me down— this leaning wall, this tottering fence?",
  "Surely they intend to topple me from my lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse.",
  "Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him.",
  "Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.",
  "My salvation and my honor depend on God; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.",
  "Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.",
  "Surely the lowborn are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie. If weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.",
  "Do not trust in extortion or put vain hope in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.",
  "One thing God has spoken, two things I have heard: “Power belongs to you, God,",
  "and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”; and, “You reward everyone according to what they have done.”"
