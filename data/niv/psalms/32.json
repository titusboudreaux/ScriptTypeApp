  "Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.",
  "Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit.",
  "When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.",
  "For day and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.",
  "Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.” And you forgave the guilt of my sin.",
  "Therefore let all the faithful pray to you while you may be found; surely the rising of the mighty waters will not reach them.",
  "You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance.",
  "I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.",
  "Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.",
  "Many are the woes of the wicked, but the Lord’s unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in him.",
  "Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!"
