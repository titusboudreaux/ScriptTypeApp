  "As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God.",
  "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?",
  "My tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”",
  "These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go to the house of God under the protection of the Mighty One with shouts of joy and praise among the festive throng.",
  "Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.",
  "My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.",
  "Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.",
  "By day the Lord directs his love, at night his song is with me— a prayer to the God of my life.",
  "I say to God my Rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?”",
  "My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, “Where is your God?”",
  "Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God."
