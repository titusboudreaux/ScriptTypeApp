[
  "Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.",
  "Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint; heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.",
  "My soul is in deep anguish. How long, Lord, how long?",
  "Turn, Lord, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.",
  "Among the dead no one proclaims your name. Who praises you from the grave?",
  "I am worn out from my groaning. All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.",
  "My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.",
  "Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.",
  "The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer.",
  "All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish; they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame."
