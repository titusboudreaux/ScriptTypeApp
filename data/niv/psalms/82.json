  "God presides in the great assembly; he renders judgment among the “gods”:",
  "“How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked?",
  "Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.",
  "Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.",
  "“The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.",
  "“I said, ‘You are “gods”; you are all sons of the Most High.’",
  "But you will die like mere mortals; you will fall like every other ruler.”",
  "Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are your inheritance."
