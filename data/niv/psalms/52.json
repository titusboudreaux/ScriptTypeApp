  "Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?",
  "You who practice deceit, your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor.",
  "You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth.",
  "You love every harmful word, you deceitful tongue!",
  "Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living.",
  "The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at you, saying,",
  "“Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!”",
  "But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God’s unfailing love for ever and ever.",
  "For what you have done I will always praise you in the presence of your faithful people. And I will hope in your name, for your name is good."
