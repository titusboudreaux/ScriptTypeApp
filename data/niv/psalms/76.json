  "God is renowned in Judah; in Israel his name is great.",
  "His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.",
  "There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war.",
  "You are radiant with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game.",
  "The valiant lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands.",
  "At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still.",
  "It is you alone who are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?",
  "From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quiet—",
  "when you, God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land.",
  "Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.",
  "Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared.",
  "He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth."
