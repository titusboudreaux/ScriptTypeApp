  "Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, my soul.",
  "I will praise the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.",
  "Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save.",
  "When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing.",
  "Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord their God.",
  "He is the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them— he remains faithful forever.",
  "He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets prisoners free,",
  "the Lord gives sight to the blind, the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down, the Lord loves the righteous.",
  "The Lord watches over the foreigner and sustains the fatherless and the widow, but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.",
  "The Lord reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the Lord."
