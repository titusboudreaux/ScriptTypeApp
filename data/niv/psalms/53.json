  "The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.",
  "God looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.",
  "Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.",
  "Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on God.",
  "But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.",
  "Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!"
