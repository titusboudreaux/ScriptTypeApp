  "How lovely is your dwelling place, Lord Almighty!",
  "My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.",
  "Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young— a place near your altar, Lord Almighty, my King and my God.",
  "Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you.",
  "Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.",
  "As they pass through the Valley of Baka, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools.",
  "They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.",
  "Hear my prayer, Lord God Almighty; listen to me, God of Jacob.",
  "Look on our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one.",
  "Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.",
  "For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.",
  "Lord Almighty, blessed is the one who trusts in you."
