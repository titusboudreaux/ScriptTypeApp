  "My heart is not proud, Lord, my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me.",
  "But I have calmed and quieted myself, I am like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child I am content.",
  "Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and forevermore."
