  "I said, “I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth while in the presence of the wicked.”",
  "So I remained utterly silent, not even saying anything good. But my anguish increased;",
  "my heart grew hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:",
  "“Show me, Lord, my life’s end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is.",
  "You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure.",
  "“Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom; in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth without knowing whose it will finally be.",
  "“But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.",
  "Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.",
  "I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.",
  "Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.",
  "When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin, you consume their wealth like a moth— surely everyone is but a breath.",
  "“Hear my prayer, Lord, listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. I dwell with you as a foreigner, a stranger, as all my ancestors were.",
  "Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again before I depart and am no more.”"
