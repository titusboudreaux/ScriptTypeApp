  "We praise you, God, we praise you, for your Name is near; people tell of your wonderful deeds.",
  "You say, “I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge with equity.",
  "When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm.",
  "To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.",
  "Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak so defiantly.’”",
  "No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt themselves.",
  "It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.",
  "In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.",
  "As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob,",
  "who says, “I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”"
