  "How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?",
  "How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and day after day have sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me?",
  "Look on me and answer, Lord my God. Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death,",
  "and my enemy will say, “I have overcome him,” and my foes will rejoice when I fall.",
  "But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation.",
  "I will sing the Lord’s praise, for he has been good to me."
