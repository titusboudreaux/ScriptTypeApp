  "He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.",
  "He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.",
  "The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.",
  "Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.",
  "But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his plan to unfold.",
  "In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wilderness they put God to the test.",
  "So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.",

  "At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.",
  "They exchanged their glorious God for an image of a bull, which eats grass.",
  "They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,",
  "miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.",
  "So he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.",
  "Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.",
  "They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the Lord.",
  "So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the wilderness,",
  "make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.",
  "They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;",
  "they aroused the Lord’s anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.",
  "But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.",
  "This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.",
  "By the waters of Meribah they angered the Lord, and trouble came to Moses because of them;",
  "for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses’ lips.",
  "They did not destroy the peoples as the Lord had commanded them,",

  "Yet he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;",
  "for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.",
  "He caused all who held them captive to show them mercy.",
  "Save us, Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.",
  "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Praise the Lord."
