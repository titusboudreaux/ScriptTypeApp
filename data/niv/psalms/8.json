  "Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens.",
  "Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.",
  "When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,",
  "what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?",
  "You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor.",
  "You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their feet:",
  "all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild,",
  "the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.",
  "Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!"
