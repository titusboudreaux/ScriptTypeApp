[
  "The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.",
  "The Lord looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.",
  "All have turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.",
  "Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the Lord.",
  "But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.",
  "You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the Lord is their refuge.",
  "Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!"
