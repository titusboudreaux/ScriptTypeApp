  "Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord;",
  "Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.",
  "If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?",
  "But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.",
  "I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope.",
  "I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning.",
  "Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love and with him is full redemption.",
  "He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins."
