  "I will exalt you, Lord, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.",
  "Lord my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me.",
  "You, Lord, brought me up from the realm of the dead; you spared me from going down to the pit.",
  "Sing the praises of the Lord, you his faithful people; praise his holy name.",
  "For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.",
  "When I felt secure, I said, “I will never be shaken.”",
  "Lord, when you favored me, you made my royal mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.",
  "To you, Lord, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:",
  "“What is gained if I am silenced, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness?",
  "Hear, Lord, and be merciful to me; Lord, be my help.”",
  "You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,",
  "that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. Lord my God, I will praise you forever."
