  "Be merciful to me, my God, for my enemies are in hot pursuit; all day long they press their attack.",
  "My adversaries pursue me all day long; in their pride many are attacking me.",
  "When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.",
  "In God, whose word I praise— in God I trust and am not afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?",
  "All day long they twist my words; all their schemes are for my ruin.",
  "They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, hoping to take my life.",
  "Because of their wickedness do not let them escape; in your anger, God, bring the nations down.",
  "Record my misery; list my tears on your scroll— are they not in your record?",
  "Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me.",
  "In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise—",
  "in God I trust and am not afraid. What can man do to me?",
  "I am under vows to you, my God; I will present my thank offerings to you.",
  "For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life."
