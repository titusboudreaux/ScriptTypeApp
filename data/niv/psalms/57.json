  "Have mercy on me, my God, have mercy on me, for in you I take refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed.",
  "I cry out to God Most High, to God, who vindicates me.",
  "He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me— God sends forth his love and his faithfulness.",
  "I am in the midst of lions; I am forced to dwell among ravenous beasts— men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.",
  "Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.",
  "They spread a net for my feet— I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path— but they have fallen into it themselves.",
  "My heart, O God, is steadfast, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.",
  "Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.",
  "I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.",
  "For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.",
  "Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth."
