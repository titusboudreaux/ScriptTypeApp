  "I love the Lord, for he heard my voice; he heard my cry for mercy.",
  "Because he turned his ear to me, I will call on him as long as I live.",
  "The cords of death entangled me, the anguish of the grave came over me; I was overcome by distress and sorrow.",
  "Then I called on the name of the Lord: “Lord, save me!”",
  "The Lord is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.",
  "The Lord protects the unwary; when I was brought low, he saved me.",
  "Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has been good to you.",
  "For you, Lord, have delivered me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling,",
  "that I may walk before the Lord in the land of the living.",
  "I trusted in the Lord when I said, “I am greatly afflicted”;",
  "in my alarm I said, “Everyone is a liar.”",
  "What shall I return to the Lord for all his goodness to me?",
  "I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord.",
  "I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people.",
  "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his faithful servants.",
  "Truly I am your servant, Lord; I serve you just as my mother did; you have freed me from my chains.",
  "I will sacrifice a thank offering to you and call on the name of the Lord.",
  "I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people,",
  "in the courts of the house of the Lord— in your midst, Jerusalem. Praise the Lord."
