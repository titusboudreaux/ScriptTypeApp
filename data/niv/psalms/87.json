  "“I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me— Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush— and will say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’”",
  "Indeed, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her.”",
  "The Lord will write in the register of the peoples: “This one was born in Zion.”",
  "As they make music they will sing, “All my fountains are in you.”"
