  "Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.",
  "Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.",
  "Arrogant foes are attacking me; ruthless people are trying to kill me— people without regard for God.",
  "Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me.",
  "Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them.",
  "I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, Lord, for it is good.",
  "You have delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes."
