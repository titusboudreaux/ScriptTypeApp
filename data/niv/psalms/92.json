  "It is good to praise the Lord and make music to your name, O Most High,",
  "proclaiming your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night,",
  "to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp.",
  "For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord; I sing for joy at what your hands have done.",
  "How great are your works, Lord, how profound your thoughts!",
  "Senseless people do not know, fools do not understand,",
  "that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever.",
  "But you, Lord, are forever exalted.",
  "For surely your enemies, Lord, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.",
  "You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured on me.",
  "My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes.",
  "The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon;",
  "planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God.",
  "They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green,",
  "proclaiming, “The Lord is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.”"
