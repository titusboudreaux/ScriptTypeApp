  "May the Lord answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.",
  "May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.",
  "May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings.",
  "May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.",
  "May we shout for joy over your victory and lift up our banners in the name of our God. May the Lord grant all your requests.",
  "Now this I know: The Lord gives victory to his anointed. He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary with the victorious power of his right hand.",
  "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.",
  "They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.",
  "Lord, give victory to the king! Answer us when we call!"
