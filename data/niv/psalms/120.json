  "I call on the Lord in my distress, and he answers me.",
  "Save me, Lord, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues.",
  "What will he do to you, and what more besides, you deceitful tongue?",
  "He will punish you with a warrior’s sharp arrows, with burning coals of the broom bush.",
  "Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek, that I live among the tents of Kedar!",
  "Too long have I lived among those who hate peace.",
  "I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war."
