  "Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.",
  "Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the plots of evildoers.",
  "They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim cruel words like deadly arrows.",
  "They shoot from ambush at the innocent; they shoot suddenly, without fear.",
  "They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, “Who will see it?”",
  "They plot injustice and say, “We have devised a perfect plan!” Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.",
  "But God will shoot them with his arrows; they will suddenly be struck down.",
  "He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.",
  "All people will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.",
  "The righteous will rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him; all the upright in heart will glory in him!"
