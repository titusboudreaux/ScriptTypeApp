  "Answer me when I call to you, my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; have mercy on me and hear my prayer.",
  "How long will you people turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods?",
  "Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him.",
  "Tremble and do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent.",
  "Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the Lord.",
  "Many, Lord, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?” Let the light of your face shine on us.",
  "Fill my heart with joy when their grain and new wine abound.",
  "In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety."
