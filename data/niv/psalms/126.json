[
  "When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed.",
  "Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.”",
  "The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.",
  "Restore our fortunes, Lord, like streams in the Negev.",
  "Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.",
  "Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them."
