  "My brothers and sisters, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism.",
  "For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and is dressed in bright clothes, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in,",
  "and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the bright clothes, and say, “You sit here in a good place,” and you say to the poor man, “You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,”",
  "have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?",
  "Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters: did God not choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?",
  "But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court?",
  "Do they not blaspheme the good name by which you have been called?",
  "If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.",
  "But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as violators.",
  "For whoever keeps the whole Law, yet stumbles in one point, has become guilty of all.",
  "For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but do murder, you have become a violator of the Law.",
  "So speak, and so act, as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.",
  "For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.",
  "What use is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works? Can that faith save him?",
  "If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,",
  "and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?",
  "In the same way, faith also, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.",
  "But someone may well say, “You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.”",
  "You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.",
  "But are you willing to acknowledge, you foolish person, that faith without works is useless?",
  "Was our father Abraham not justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?",
  "You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;",
  "and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God.",
  "You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.",
  "In the same way, was Rahab the prostitute not justified by works also when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?",
  "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."
