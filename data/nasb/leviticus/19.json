  "Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:",

  "‘You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another.",
  "And you shall not swear falsely by My name, so as to profane the name of your God; I am the Lord.",
  "‘You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of a hired worker are not to remain with you all night until morning.",

  "You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people; and you are not to jeopardize the life of your neighbor. I am the Lord.",
  "‘You shall not hate your fellow countryman in your heart; you may certainly rebuke your neighbor, but you are not to incur sin because of him.",
  "You shall not take vengeance, nor hold any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the Lord.",
  "‘You are to keep My statutes. You shall not cross-breed two kinds of your cattle; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, nor wear a garment of two kinds of material mixed together.",
  "‘Now if a man has sexual relations with a woman who is a slave acquired for another man, but who has in no way been redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be punishment; they shall not, however, be put to death, because she was not free.",
  "He shall bring his guilt offering to the Lord to the doorway of the tent of meeting, a ram as a guilt offering.",
  "The priest shall also make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the Lord for his sin which he has committed, and the sin which he has committed will be forgiven him.",
  "‘Now when you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden. For three years it shall be forbidden to you; it shall not be eaten.",

  "‘You shall stand up in the presence of the grayheaded and honor elders, and you shall fear your God; I am the Lord.",
  "‘When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.",
  "The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God.",
  "‘You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measurement of weight, or volume.",
  "You shall have accurate balances, accurate weights, an accurate ephah, and an accurate hin; I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt.",
  "So you shall keep all My statutes and all My ordinances, and do them; I am the Lord.’”"
