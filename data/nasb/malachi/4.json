  "“For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze,” says the Lord of armies, “so that it will leave them neither root nor branches.",
  "But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings; and you will go forth and frolic like calves from the stall.",
  "And you will crush the wicked underfoot, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I am preparing,” says the Lord of armies.",
  "“Remember the Law of Moses My servant, the statutes and ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel.",
  "“Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord.",
  "He will turn the hearts of the fathers back to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I will not come and strike the land with complete destruction.”"
