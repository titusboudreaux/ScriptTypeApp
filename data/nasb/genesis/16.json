  "Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had not borne him a child, but she had an Egyptian slave woman whose name was Hagar.",
  "So Sarai said to Abram, “See now, the Lord has prevented me from bearing children. Please have relations with my slave woman; perhaps I will obtain children through her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.",
  "And so after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her slave woman, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife.",
  "Then he had relations with Hagar, and she conceived; and when Hagar became aware that she had conceived, her mistress was insignificant in her sight.",
  "So Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be upon you! I put my slave woman into your arms, but when she saw that she had conceived, I was insignificant in her sight. May the Lord judge between you and me.”",
  "But Abram said to Sarai, “Look, your slave woman is in your power; do to her what is good in your sight.” So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence.",
  "Now the angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.",
  "He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s slave woman, from where have you come, and where are you going?” And she said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.”",
  "So the angel of the Lord said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit to her authority.”",
  "The angel of the Lord also said to her, “I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count.”",
  "The angel of the Lord said to her further, “Behold, you are pregnant, And you will give birth to a son; And you shall name him Ishmael, Because the Lord has heard your affliction.",
  "But he will be a wild donkey of a man; His hand will be against everyone, And everyone’s hand will be against him; And he will live in defiance of all his brothers.”",
  "Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees me”; for she said, “Have I even seen Him here and lived after He saw me?”",
  "Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.",
  "So Hagar bore a son to Abram; and Abram named his son, to whom Hagar gave birth, Ishmael.",
  "Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him."
