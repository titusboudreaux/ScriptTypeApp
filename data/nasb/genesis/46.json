  "So Israel set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.",
  "And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And he said, “Here I am.”",
  "Then He said, “I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there.",
  "I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also assuredly bring you up again; and Joseph will close your eyes.”",
  "Then Jacob left Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.",
  "They also took their livestock and their possessions, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him:",
  "his sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt.",
  "Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.",
  "And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.",
  "And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.",
  "And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.",
  "And the sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.",
  "And the sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvvah, Iob, and Shimron.",
  "And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.",
  "These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three.",
  "And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.",
  "And the sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.",
  "These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen persons.",
  "The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.",
  "Now to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.",
  "And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.",
  "These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; there were fourteen persons in all.",
  "And the sons of Dan: Hushim.",
  "And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.",
  "These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and she bore these to Jacob; there were seven persons in all.",
  "All the people belonging to Jacob, who came to Egypt, his direct descendants, not including the wives of Jacob’s sons, were sixty-six persons in all,",
  "and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two; all the people of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, were seventy.",
  "Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to guide him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.",
  "And Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; as soon as he appeared to him, Joseph threw himself on his neck and wept on his neck a long time.",
  "Then Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.”",
  "But Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me;",
  "and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’",
  "When Pharaoh calls for you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’",
  "you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock since our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,’ so that you may live in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”"
