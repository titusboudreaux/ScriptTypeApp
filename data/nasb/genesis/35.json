  "and let’s arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me on the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.”",

  "Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him.",
  "God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; You shall no longer be called Jacob, But Israel shall be your name.” So He called him Israel.",
  "God also said to him, “I am God Almighty; Be fruitful and multiply; A nation and a multitude of nations shall come from you, And kings shall come from you.",
  "And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you, And I will give the land to your descendants after you.”",
  "Then God went up from him at the place where He had spoken with him.",
  "So Jacob set up a memorial stone in the place where He had spoken with him, a memorial of stone, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.",

  "the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin;",
