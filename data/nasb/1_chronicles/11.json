  "Then all Israel gathered to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.",
  "In times past, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led out and brought in Israel; and the Lord your God said to you, ‘You shall shepherd My people Israel, and you shall be leader over My people Israel.’”",
  "So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they anointed David king over Israel, in accordance with the word of the Lord through Samuel.",
  "Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.",
  "The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You shall not enter here.” Nevertheless David took the mountain stronghold of Zion (that is, the city of David).",
  "Now David had said, “Whoever is first to kill a Jebusite shall be chief and commander.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.",
  "Then David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.",
  "He built the city all around, from the Millo to the surrounding area; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.",
  "And David became greater and greater, for the Lord of armies was with him.",
  "Now these are the heads of the mighty men whom David had, who remained faithful to him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, in accordance with the word of the Lord concerning Israel.",
  "These constitute the list of David’s mighty men: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he wielded his spear against three hundred whom he killed at one time.",

  "He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered together there to battle, and there was a plot of land full of barley; and the people fled from the Philistines.",
  "But they took their stand in the midst of the plot and defended it, and defeated the Philistines; and the Lord saved them with a great victory.",
  "Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam, while the army of the Philistines was camping in the Valley of Rephaim.",
  "David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.",
  "And David had a craving and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”",
  "So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David; however, David would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord;",
  "and he said, “Far be it from me before my God that I would do this. Shall I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives? For they brought it at the risk of their lives.” Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.",
  "As for Abshai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the thirty, and he wielded his spear against three hundred and killed them; and he had a name as well as the thirty.",
  "Of the three in the second rank he was the most honored, and he became their commander; however, he did not attain the reputation of the first three.",
  "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a warrior of Kabzeel, mighty in deeds, struck and killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and struck and killed a lion inside a pit on a snowy day.",
  "And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature five cubits tall. Now in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam, but he went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.",
  "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name as well as the three mighty men.",
  "Behold, he was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain the reputation of the first three; and David appointed him over his bodyguard.",
  "Now the mighty men of the armies were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,",
  "Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,",
  "Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,",
  "Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,",
  "Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,",
  "Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,",
  "Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,",
  "Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,",
