  "Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.",
  "He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Uzziah had done; however he did not enter the temple of the Lord. But the people continued acting corruptly.",
  "He built the upper gate of the house of the Lord, and he built the wall of Ophel extensively.",
  "Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built fortresses and towers on the wooded hills.",
  "He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them so that during that year the Ammonites gave him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites also paid him this amount in the second year and in the third.",
  "So Jotham became powerful because he directed his ways before the Lord his God.",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.",
  "He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for sixteen years.",
  "And Jotham lay down with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and his son Ahaz became king in his place."
