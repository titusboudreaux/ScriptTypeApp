  "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be unaware.",
  "You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the mute idols, however you were led.",
  "Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed”; and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.",
  "Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.",
  "And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.",
  "There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons.",
  "But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.",
  "For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;",
  "to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,",
  "and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.",
  "But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.",
  "For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.",
  "For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.",
  "For the body is not one part, but many.",
  "If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” it is not for this reason any less a part of the body.",
  "And if the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,” it is not for this reason any less a part of the body.",
  "If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?",
  "But now God has arranged the parts, each one of them in the body, just as He desired.",
  "If they were all one part, where would the body be?",
  "But now there are many parts, but one body.",
  "And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”; or again, the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”",
  "On the contrary, it is much truer that the parts of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary;",
  "and those parts of the body which we consider less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor, and our less presentable parts become much more presentable,",
  "whereas our more presentable parts have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked,",
  "so that there may be no division in the body, but that the parts may have the same care for one another.",
  "And if one part of the body suffers, all the parts suffer with it; if a part is honored, all the parts rejoice with it.",
  "Now you are Christ’s body, and individually parts of it.",
  "And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and various kinds of tongues.",
  "All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are they?",
  "All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?",
  "But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And yet, I am going to show you a far better way."
