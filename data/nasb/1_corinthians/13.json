  "If I speak with the tongues of mankind and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.",
  "If I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.",
  "And if I give away all my possessions to charity, and if I surrender my body so that I may glory, but do not have love, it does me no good.",
  "Love is patient, love is kind, it is not jealous; love does not brag, it is not arrogant.",
  "It does not act disgracefully, it does not seek its own benefit; it is not provoked, does not keep an account of a wrong suffered,",
  "it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;",
  "it keeps every confidence, it believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
  "Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away with; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away with.",
  "For we know in part and prophesy in part;",
  "but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away with.",
  "When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.",
  "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known.",
  "But now faith, hope, and love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love."
