  "But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.",
  "And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,",
  "but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.",
  "While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in gleaming clothing;",
  "and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why are you seeking the living One among the dead?",
  "He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,",
  "saying that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise from the dead.”",
  "And they remembered His words,",
  "and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.",
  "Now these women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles.",
  "But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe the women.",
  "Nevertheless, Peter got up and ran to the tomb; and when he stooped and looked in, he saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened.",
  "And behold, on that very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.",
  "And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.",
  "While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them.",
  "But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.",
  "And He said to them, “What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?” And they came to a stop, looking sad.",
  "One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, “Are You possibly the only one living near Jerusalem who does not know about the things that happened here in these days?”",
  "And He said to them, “What sort of things?” And they said to Him, “Those about Jesus the Nazarene, who proved to be a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,",
  "and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him.",
  "But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.",
  "But also some women among us left us bewildered. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,",
  "and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.",
  "And so some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see.”",
  "And then He said to them, “You foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!",
  "Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to come into His glory?”",
  "Then beginning with Moses and with all the Prophets, He explained to them the things written about Himself in all the Scriptures.",
  "And they approached the village where they were going, and He gave the impression that He was going farther.",
  "And so they strongly urged Him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is getting toward evening, and the day is now nearly over.” So He went in to stay with them.",
  "And it came about, when He had reclined at the table with them, that He took the bread and blessed it, and He broke it and began giving it to them.",
  "And then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.",
  "They said to one another, “Were our hearts not burning within us when He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?”",
  "And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them,",
  "saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!”",
  "They began to relate their experiences on the road, and how He was recognized by them at the breaking of the bread.",
  "Now while they were telling these things, Jesus Himself suddenly stood in their midst and said to them, “Peace be to you.”",
  "But they were startled and frightened, and thought that they were looking at a spirit.",
  "And He said to them, “Why are you frightened, and why are doubts arising in your hearts?",
  "See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you plainly see that I have.”",
  "And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.",
  "While they still could not believe it because of their joy and astonishment, He said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?”",
  "They served Him a piece of broiled fish;",
  "and He took it and ate it in front of them.",
  "Now He said to them, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things that are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”",
  "Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,",
  "and He said to them, “So it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,",
  "and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.",
  "You are witnesses of these things.",
  "And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”",
  "And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.",
  "While He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven.",
  "And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,",
  "and were continually in the temple praising God."
