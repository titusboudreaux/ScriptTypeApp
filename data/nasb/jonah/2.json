  "Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish,",
  "and he said, “I called out of my distress to the Lord, And He answered me. I called for help from the depth of Sheol; You heard my voice.",
  "For You threw me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the current flowed around me. All Your breakers and waves passed over me.",
  "So I said, ‘I have been cast out of Your sight. Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple.’",
  "Water encompassed me to the point of death. The deep flowed around me, Seaweed was wrapped around my head.",
  "I descended to the base of the mountains. The earth with its bars was around me forever, But You have brought up my life from the pit, Lord my God.",
  "While I was fainting away, I remembered the Lord, And my prayer came to You, Into Your holy temple.",
  "Those who are followers of worthless idols Abandon their faithfulness,",
  "But I will sacrifice to You With a voice of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the Lord.”",
  "Then the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land."
