  "The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered to Him after they came from Jerusalem,",
  "and saw that some of His disciples were eating their bread with unholy hands, that is, unwashed.",
  "(For the Pharisees and all the other Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, thereby holding firmly to the tradition of the elders;",
  "and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they completely cleanse themselves; and there are many other things which they have received as traditions to firmly hold, such as the washing of cups, pitchers, and copper pots.)",
  "And the Pharisees and the scribes asked Him, “Why do Your disciples not walk in accordance with the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unholy hands?”",
  "But He said to them, “Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘This people honors Me with their lips, But their heart is far away from Me.",
  "And in vain do they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’",
  "Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.”",
  "He was also saying to them, “You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.",
  "For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother, is certainly to be put to death’;",
  "but you say, ‘If a person says to his father or his mother, whatever I have that would help you is Corban (that is, given to God),’",
  "you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother;",
  "thereby invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that.”",
  "After He called the crowd to Him again, He began saying to them, “Listen to Me, all of you, and understand:",
  "there is nothing outside the person which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which come out of the person are what defile the person.”",
  "And when He later entered a house, away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him about the parable.",
  "And He said to them, “Are you so lacking in understanding as well? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the person from outside cannot defile him,",
  "because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is eliminated?” (Thereby He declared all foods clean.)",
  "And He was saying, “That which comes out of the person, that is what defiles the person.",
  "For from within, out of the hearts of people, come the evil thoughts, acts of sexual immorality, thefts, murders, acts of adultery,",
  "deeds of greed, wickedness, deceit, indecent behavior, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.",
  "All these evil things come from within and defile the person.”",
  "Now Jesus got up and went from there to the region of Tyre. And when He had entered a house, He wanted no one to know about it; and yet He could not escape notice.",
  "But after hearing about Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet.",
  "Now the woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician descent. And she repeatedly asked Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.",
  "And He was saying to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”",
  "But she answered and said to Him, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table feed on the children’s crumbs.”",
  "And He said to her, “Because of this answer, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”",
  "And after going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.",
  "Again He left the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of Decapolis.",
  "And they brought to Him one who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they begged Him to lay His hand on him.",
  "And Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers in his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue with the saliva;",
  "and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”",
  "And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he began speaking plainly.",
  "And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it.",
  "And they were utterly astonished, saying, “He has done all things well; He makes even those who are deaf hear, and those who are unable to talk, speak.”"
