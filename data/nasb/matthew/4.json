  "And the tempter came and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”",
  "But He answered and said, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.’”",
  "Then the devil took Him along into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple,",
  "and he said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written: ‘He will give His angels orders concerning You’; and ‘On their hands they will lift You up, So that You do not strike Your foot against a stone.’”",
  "Jesus said to him, “On the other hand, it is written: ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”",
  "Again, the devil took Him along to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory;",
  "and he said to Him, “All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.”",
  "Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.’”",
  "Then the devil left Him; and behold, angels came and began to serve Him.",
  "Now when Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody, He withdrew into Galilee;",
  "and leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.",

  "“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, By the way of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—",

  "Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.",
