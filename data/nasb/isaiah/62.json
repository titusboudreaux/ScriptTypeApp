  "For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, And for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep quiet, Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness, And her salvation like a torch that is burning.",
  "The nations will see your righteousness, And all kings your glory; And you will be called by a new name Which the mouth of the Lord will designate.",
  "You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, And a royal headband in the hand of your God.",
  "It will no longer be said to you, “Forsaken,” Nor to your land will it any longer be said, “Desolate”; But you will be called, “My delight is in her,” And your land, “Married”; For the Lord delights in you, And to Him your land will be married.",
  "For as a young man marries a virgin, So your sons will marry you; And as the groom rejoices over the bride, So your God will rejoice over you.",
  "On your walls, Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen; All day and all night they will never keep silent. You who profess the Lord, take no rest for yourselves;",
  "And give Him no rest until He establishes And makes Jerusalem an object of praise on the earth.",
  "The Lord has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm: “I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies, Nor will foreigners drink your new wine for which you have labored.”",
  "But those who harvest it will eat it and praise the Lord; And those who gather it will drink it in the courtyards of My sanctuary.",
  "Go through, go through the gates, Clear a way for the people! Build up, build up the highway, Remove the stones, lift up a flag over the peoples.",
  "Behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the daughter of Zion, “Behold, your salvation is coming; Behold His reward is with Him, and His compensation before Him.”",
  "And they will call them, “The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord”; And you will be called, “Sought Out, A City Not Abandoned.”"
