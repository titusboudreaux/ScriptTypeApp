  "Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we thought it best to be left behind, alone at Athens,",
  "and we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you for the benefit of your faith,",
  "so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.",
  "For even when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction; and so it happened, as you know.",
  "For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be for nothing.",
  "But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us, longing to see us just as we also long to see you,",
  "for this reason, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;",
  "for now we really live, if you stand firm in the Lord.",
  "For what thanks can we give to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God,",
  "as we keep praying most earnestly night and day that we may see your faces, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?",
  "Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you;",
  "and may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow in love for one another, and for all people, just as we also do for you;",
  "so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints."
