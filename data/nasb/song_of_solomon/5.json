  "“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends; Drink and drink deeply, lovers.”",
  "“I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: ‘Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the dew drops of the night.’",
  "I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?",
  "My beloved extended his hand through the opening, And my feelings were stirred for him.",
  "I arose to open to my beloved; And my hands dripped with myrrh, And my fingers with drops of myrrh, On the handles of the bolt.",
  "I opened to my beloved, But my beloved had turned away and had gone! My heart went out to him as he spoke. I searched for him but I did not find him; I called him but he did not answer me.",
  "The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, They struck me and wounded me; The guards of the walls took my shawl away from me.",
  "Swear to me, you daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, As to what you will tell him: For I am lovesick.”",
  "“What kind of beloved is your beloved, O most beautiful among women? What kind of beloved is your beloved, That you make us swear in this way?”",
  "“My beloved is dazzling and reddish, Outstanding among ten thousand.",
  "His head is like gold, pure gold; His locks are like clusters of dates And black as a raven.",
  "His eyes are like doves Beside streams of water, Bathed in milk, And perched in their setting.",
  "His cheeks are like a bed of balsam, Banks of herbal spices; His lips are lilies Dripping with drops of myrrh.",
  "His hands are rods of gold Set with topaz; His abdomen is panels of ivory Covered with sapphires.",
  "His thighs are pillars of alabaster Set on pedestals of pure gold; His appearance is like Lebanon, Choice as the cedars.",
  "His mouth is full of sweetness. And he is wholly desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, You daughters of Jerusalem.”"
