  "Then Job responded,",
  "“What a help you are to the weak! You have saved the arm without strength!",
  "What advice you have given to one without wisdom! What helpful insight you have abundantly provided!",
  "To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit was expressed through you?",
  "“The departed spirits are made to tremble Under the waters and their inhabitants.",
  "Sheol is naked before Him, And Abaddon has no covering.",
  "He stretches out the north over empty space And hangs the earth on nothing.",
  "He wraps up the waters in His clouds, And the cloud does not burst under them.",
  "He obscures the face of the full moon And spreads His cloud over it.",
  "He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters At the boundary of light and darkness.",
  "The pillars of heaven tremble And are amazed at His rebuke.",
  "With His power He quieted the sea, And by His understanding He shattered Rahab.",
  "By His breath the heavens are cleared; His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent.",
  "Behold, these are the fringes of His ways; And how faint a word we hear of Him! But His mighty thunder, who can understand?”"
