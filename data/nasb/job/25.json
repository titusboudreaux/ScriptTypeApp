  "Then Bildad the Shuhite responded,",
  "“Dominion and awe belong to Him Who makes peace in His heights.",
  "Is there any number to His troops? And upon whom does His light not rise?",
  "How then can mankind be righteous with God? Or how can anyone who is born of woman be pure?",
  "If even the moon has no brightness And the stars are not pure in His sight,",
  "How much less man, that maggot, And a son of man, that worm!”"
