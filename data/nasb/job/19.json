  "Then Job responded,",
  "“How long will you torment me And crush me with words?",
  "These ten times you have insulted me; You are not ashamed to wrong me.",
  "Even if I have truly done wrong, My error stays with me.",
  "If indeed you exalt yourselves against me And prove my disgrace to me,",
  "Know then that God has wronged me And has surrounded me with His net.",
  "“Behold, I cry, ‘Violence!’ but I get no answer; I shout for help, but there is no justice.",
  "He has blocked my way so that I cannot pass, And He has put darkness on my paths.",
  "He has stripped my honor from me And removed the crown from my head.",
  "He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; And He has uprooted my hope like a tree.",
  "He has also kindled His anger against me And considered me as His enemy.",
  "His troops come together And build up their way against me And camp around my tent.",
  "“He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances have completely turned away from me.",
  "My relatives have failed, And my close friends have forgotten me.",
  "Those who live in my house and my servant women consider me a stranger. I am a foreigner in their sight.",
  "I call to my servant, but he does not answer; I have to implore his favor with my mouth.",
  "My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am loathsome to my own brothers.",
  "Even young children despise me; I stand up and they speak against me.",
  "All my associates loathe me, And those I love have turned against me.",
  "My bone clings to my skin and my flesh, And I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth.",
  "Pity me, pity me, you friends of mine, For the hand of God has struck me.",
  "Why do you persecute me as God does, And are not satisfied with my flesh?",
  "“Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were recorded in a book!",
  "That with an iron stylus and lead They were engraved in the rock forever!",
  "Yet as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, And at the last, He will take His stand on the earth.",
  "Even after my skin is destroyed, Yet from my flesh I will see God,",
  "Whom I, on my part, shall behold for myself, And whom my eyes will see, and not another. My heart faints within me!",
  "If you say, ‘How shall we persecute him?’ And ‘What pretext for a case against him can we find?’",
  "Then be afraid of the sword for yourselves, For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, So that you may know there is judgment.”"
