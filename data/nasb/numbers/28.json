  "Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,",
  "“Command the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘You shall be careful to present to Me My offering, My food for My offerings by fire, of a soothing aroma to Me, at their appointed time.’",
  "And you shall say to them, ‘This is the offering by fire which you shall offer to the Lord: two male lambs one year old without defect as a continual burnt offering every day.",
  "You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;",
  "also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a hin of pure oil.",
  "It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained on Mount Sinai as a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the Lord.",
  "Then the drink offering with it shall be a fourth of a hin for each lamb; in the Holy Place pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the Lord.",
  "The other lamb you shall offer at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to the Lord.",
  "‘Then on the Sabbath day two male lambs one year old without defect, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and its drink offering:",
  "This is the burnt offering of every Sabbath in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.",
  "‘Then at the beginning of each of your months you shall present a burnt offering to the Lord: two bulls and one ram, seven male lambs one year old without defect;",
  "and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, for the one ram;",
  "and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering of a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the Lord.",
  "Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year.",
  "And one male goat as a sin offering to the Lord; it shall be offered with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering.",
  "‘The Lord’s Passover shall be on the fourteenth day of the first month.",
  "On the fifteenth day of this month there shall be a feast; unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days.",
  "On the first day there shall be a holy assembly; you shall do no laborious work.",
  "But you shall present an offering by fire, a burnt offering to the Lord: two bulls and one ram, and seven male lambs one year old, that you have without defect.",
  "For their grain offering, you shall offer fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for a bull, and two-tenths for the ram.",
  "A tenth of an ephah you shall offer for each of the seven lambs;",
  "and one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you.",
  "You shall present these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.",
  "In this way you shall present daily, for seven days, the food of the offering by fire, of a soothing aroma to the Lord; it shall be presented with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering.",
  "On the seventh day you shall have a holy assembly; you shall do no laborious work.",
  "‘Also on the day of the first fruits, when you present a new grain offering to the Lord in your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy assembly; you shall do no laborious work.",
  "But you shall offer a burnt offering as a soothing aroma to the Lord: two bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs one year old;",
  "and as their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram,",
  "and a tenth for each of the seven lambs;",
  "also one male goat to make atonement for you.",
  "Besides the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, you shall present them with their drink offerings. They shall be without defect."
