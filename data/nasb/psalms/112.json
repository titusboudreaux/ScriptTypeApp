  "Praise the Lord! Blessed is a person who fears the Lord, Who greatly delights in His commandments.",
  "His descendants will be mighty on the earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed.",
  "Wealth and riches are in his house, And his righteousness endures forever.",
  "Light shines in the darkness for the upright; He is gracious, compassionate, and righteous.",
  "It goes well for a person who is gracious and lends; He will maintain his cause in judgment.",
  "For he will never be shaken; The righteous will be remembered forever.",
  "He will not fear bad news; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord.",
  "His heart is firm, he will not fear, But will look with satisfaction on his enemies.",
  "He has given freely to the poor, His righteousness endures forever; His horn will be exalted in honor.",
  "The wicked will see it and be vexed, He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked will perish."
