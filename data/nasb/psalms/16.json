  "Protect me, God, for I take refuge in You.",
  "I said to the Lord, “You are my Lord; I have nothing good besides You.”",
  "As for the saints who are on the earth, They are the majestic ones; all my delight is in them.",
  "The pains of those who have acquired another god will be multiplied; I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, Nor will I take their names upon my lips.",
  "The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You support my lot.",
  "The measuring lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; Indeed, my inheritance is beautiful to me.",
  "I will bless the Lord who has advised me; Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night.",
  "I have set the Lord continually before me; Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.",
  "Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will dwell securely.",
  "For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.",
  "You will make known to me the way of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; In Your right hand there are pleasures forever."
