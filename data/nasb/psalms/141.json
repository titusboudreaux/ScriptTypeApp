  "Lord, I call upon You; hurry to me! Listen to my voice when I call to You!",
  "May my prayer be counted as incense before You; The raising of my hands as the evening offering.",
  "Set a guard, Lord, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips.",
  "Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, To practice deeds of wickedness With people who do wrong; And may I not taste their delicacies.",
  "May the righteous strike me with mercy and discipline me; It is oil for the head; My head shall not refuse it, For my prayer is still against their evil deeds.",
  "Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock, And they hear my words, for they are pleasant.",
  "As when one plows and breaks open the earth, Our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.",
  "For my eyes are toward You, God, the Lord; In You I take refuge; do not leave me defenseless.",
  "Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, And from the snares of those who do wrong.",
  "May the wicked fall into their own nets, While I pass by safely."
