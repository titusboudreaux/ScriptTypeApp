  "God, why have You rejected us forever? Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?",
  "Remember Your congregation, which You purchased of old, Which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your inheritance; And this Mount Zion, where You have dwelt.",
  "Step toward the irreparable ruins; The enemy has damaged everything in the sanctuary.",
  "Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your meeting place; They have set up their own signs as signs.",
  "It seems like one bringing up His axe into a forest of trees.",
  "And now they break down all its carved work With axe and hammers.",
  "They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name.",
  "They said in their heart, “Let’s completely subdue them.” They have burned all the meeting places of God in the land.",
  "We do not see our signs; There is no longer any prophet, Nor is there anyone among us who knows how long.",
  "How long, God, will the enemy taunt You? Shall the enemy treat Your name disrespectfully forever?",
  "Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? Extend it from Your chest and destroy them!",
  "Yet God is my King from long ago, Who performs acts of salvation in the midst of the earth.",
  "You divided the sea by Your strength; You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.",
  "You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.",
  "You broke open springs and torrents; You dried up ever-flowing streams.",
  "Yours is the day, Yours also is the night; You have prepared the light and the sun.",
  "You have established all the boundaries of the earth; You have created summer and winter.",
  "Remember this, Lord, that the enemy has taunted You, And a foolish people has treated Your name disrespectfully.",
  "Do not give the soul of Your turtledove to the wild animal; Do not forget the life of Your afflicted forever.",
  "Consider the covenant; For the dark places of the land are full of the places of violence.",
  "May the oppressed person not return dishonored; May the afflicted and the needy praise Your name.",
  "Arise, God, and plead Your own cause; Remember how the foolish person taunts You all day long.",
  "Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries, The uproar of those who rise against You, which ascends continually."
