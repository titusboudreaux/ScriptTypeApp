[
  "Unless the Lord builds a house, They who build it labor in vain; Unless the Lord guards a city, The watchman stays awake in vain.",
  "It is futile for you to rise up early, To stay up late, To eat the bread of painful labor; This is how He gives to His beloved sleep.",
  "Behold, children are a gift of the Lord, The fruit of the womb is a reward.",
  "Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of one’s youth.",
  "Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate."
