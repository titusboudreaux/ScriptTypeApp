  "Vindicate me, God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; Save me from the deceitful and unjust person!",
  "For You are the God of my strength; why have You rejected me? Why do I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?",
  "Send out Your light and Your truth, they shall lead me; They shall bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places.",
  "Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And I will praise You on the lyre, God, my God.",
  "Why are you in despair, my soul? And why are you restless within me? Wait for God, for I will again praise Him For the help of His presence, my God."
