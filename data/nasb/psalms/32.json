  "How blessed is he whose wrongdoing is forgiven, Whose sin is covered!",
  "How blessed is a person whose guilt the Lord does not take into account, And in whose spirit there is no deceit!",
  "When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away Through my groaning all day long.",
  "For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; My vitality failed as with the dry heat of summer. Selah",
  "I acknowledged my sin to You, And I did not hide my guilt; I said, “I will confess my wrongdoings to the Lord”; And You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah",
  "Therefore, let everyone who is godly pray to You in a time when You may be found; Certainly in a flood of great waters, they will not reach him.",
  "You are my hiding place; You keep me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah",
  "I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will advise you with My eye upon you.",
  "Do not be like the horse or like the mule, which have no understanding, Whose trappings include bit and bridle to hold them in check, Otherwise they will not come near to you.",
  "The sorrows of the wicked are many, But the one who trusts in the Lord, goodness will surround him.",
  "Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous ones; And shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart."
