  "“Had it not been the Lord who was on our side,” Let Israel say,",
  "“Had it not been the Lord who was on our side When people rose up against us,",
  "Then they would have swallowed us alive, When their anger was kindled against us;",
  "Then the waters would have flooded over us, The stream would have swept over our souls;",
  "Then the raging waters would have swept over our souls.”",
  "Blessed be the Lord, Who has not given us to be torn by their teeth.",
  "Our souls have escaped like a bird from the trapper’s snare; The snare is broken and we have escaped.",
  "Our help is in the name of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth."
