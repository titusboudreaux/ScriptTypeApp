  "Why do you boast in evil, you mighty man? The faithfulness of God endures all day long.",
  "Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit.",
  "You love evil more than good, Lies more than speaking what is right. Selah",
  "You love all words that devour, You deceitful tongue.",
  "But God will break you down forever; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent, And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah",
  "The righteous will see and fear, And they will laugh at him, saying,",
  "“Behold, the man who would not make God his refuge, But trusted in the abundance of his riches And was strong in his evil desire.”",
  "But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the faithfulness of God forever and ever.",
  "I will praise You forever, because You have done it, And I will wait on Your name, for it is good, in the presence of Your godly ones."
