  "One who dwells in the shelter of the Most High Will lodge in the shadow of the Almighty.",
  "I will say to the Lord, “My refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust!”",
  "For it is He who rescues you from the net of the trapper And from the deadly plague.",
  "He will cover you with His pinions, And under His wings you may take refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and wall.",
  "You will not be afraid of the terror by night, Or of the arrow that flies by day;",
  "Of the plague that stalks in darkness, Or of the destruction that devastates at noon.",
  "A thousand may fall at your side And ten thousand at your right hand, But it shall not approach you.",
  "You will only look on with your eyes And see the retaliation against the wicked.",
  "For you have made the Lord, my refuge, The Most High, your dwelling place.",
  "No evil will happen to you, Nor will any plague come near your tent.",
  "For He will give His angels orders concerning you, To protect you in all your ways.",
  "On their hands they will lift you up, So that you do not strike your foot against a stone.",
  "You will walk upon the lion and cobra, You will trample the young lion and the serpent.",
  "“Because he has loved Me, I will save him; I will set him securely on high, because he has known My name.",
  "He will call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him.",
  "I will satisfy him with a long life, And show him My salvation.”"
