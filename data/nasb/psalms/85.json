  "Lord, You showed favor to Your land; You restored the fortunes of Jacob.",
  "You forgave the guilt of Your people; You covered all their sin. Selah",
  "You withdrew all Your fury; You turned away from Your burning anger.",
  "Restore us, God of our salvation, And cause Your indignation toward us to cease.",
  "Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger to all generations?",
  "Will You not revive us again, So that Your people may rejoice in You?",
  "Show us Your mercy, Lord, And grant us Your salvation.",
  "I will hear what God the Lord will say; For He will speak peace to His people, to His godly ones; And may they not turn back to foolishness.",
  "Certainly His salvation is near to those who fear Him, That glory may dwell in our land.",
  "Graciousness and truth have met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.",
  "Truth sprouts from the earth, And righteousness looks down from heaven.",
  "Indeed, the Lord will give what is good, And our land will yield its produce.",
  "Righteousness will go before Him And will make His footsteps into a way."
