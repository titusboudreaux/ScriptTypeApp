[
  "Those who trust in the Lord Are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but remains forever.",
  "As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the Lord surrounds His people From this time and forever.",
  "For the scepter of wickedness will not rest upon the land of the righteous, So that the righteous will not extend their hands to do wrong.",
  "Do good, Lord, to those who are good And to those who are upright in their hearts.",
  "But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, The Lord will lead them away with those who practice injustice. Peace be upon Israel."
