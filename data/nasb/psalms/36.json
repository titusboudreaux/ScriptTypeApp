  "Wrongdoing speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes.",
  "For it flatters him in his own eyes Concerning the discovery of his wrongful deed and the hatred of it.",
  "The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise and to do good.",
  "He plans wickedness on his bed; He sets himself on a path that is not good; He does not reject evil.",
  "Your mercy, Lord, extends to the heavens, Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.",
  "Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; Your judgments are like the great deep. Lord, You protect mankind and animals.",
  "How precious is Your mercy, God! And the sons of mankind take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.",
  "They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house; And You allow them to drink from the river of Your delights.",
  "For the fountain of life is with You; In Your light we see light.",
  "Prolong Your mercy to those who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright of heart.",
  "May the foot of pride not come upon me, And may the hand of the wicked not drive me away.",
  "Those who do injustice have fallen there; They have been thrust down and cannot rise."
