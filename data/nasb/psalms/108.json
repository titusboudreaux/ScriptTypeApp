  "My heart is steadfast, God; I will sing, I will sing praises also with my soul.",
  "Awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn!",
  "I will give thanks to You, Lord, among the peoples, And I will sing praises to You among the nations.",
  "For Your mercy is great above the heavens, And Your truth reaches to the skies.",
  "Be exalted above the heavens, God, And may Your glory be above all the earth.",
  "So that Your beloved may be rescued, Save with Your right hand, and answer me!",
  "God has spoken in His holiness: “I will triumph, I will divide up Shechem, And measure out the Valley of Succoth.",
  "Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.",
  "Moab is My washbowl; I will throw My sandal over Edom; I will shout aloud over Philistia.”",
  "Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?",
  "God, have You Yourself not rejected us? And will You not go forth with our armies, God?",
  "Give us help against the enemy, For deliverance by man is worthless.",
  "Through God we will do valiantly, And it is He who will trample down our enemies."
