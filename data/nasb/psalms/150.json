  "Praise the Lord! Praise God in His sanctuary; Praise Him in His mighty expanse.",
  "Praise Him for His mighty deeds; Praise Him according to His excellent greatness.",
  "Praise Him with trumpet sound; Praise Him with harp and lyre.",
  "Praise Him with tambourine and dancing; Praise Him with stringed instruments and flute.",
  "Praise Him with loud cymbals; Praise Him with resounding cymbals.",
  "Everything that has breath shall praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!"
