  "I will sing of mercy and justice; To You, Lord, I will sing praises.",
  "I will carefully attend to the blameless way. When will You come to me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.",
  "I will set no worthless thing before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; It shall not cling to me.",
  "A perverse heart shall leave me; I will know no evil.",
  "Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him I will destroy; I will not endure one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart.",
  "My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; One who walks in a blameless way is one who will serve me.",
  "One who practices deceit shall not dwell within my house; One who speaks lies shall not maintain his position before me.",
  "Every morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, So as to eliminate from the city of the Lord all those who do injustice."
