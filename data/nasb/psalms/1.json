  "Blessed is the person who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!",
  "But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, And on His Law he meditates day and night.",
  "He will be like a tree planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season, And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers.",
  "The wicked are not so, But they are like chaff which the wind blows away.",
  "Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.",
  "For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked will perish."
