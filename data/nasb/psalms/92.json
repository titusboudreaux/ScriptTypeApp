  "It is good to give thanks to the Lord And to sing praises to Your name, Most High;",
  "To declare Your goodness in the morning And Your faithfulness by night,",
  "With the ten-stringed lute and with the harp, With resounding music on the lyre.",
  "For You, Lord, have made me joyful by what You have done, I will sing for joy over the works of Your hands.",
  "How great are Your works, Lord! Your thoughts are very deep.",
  "A stupid person has no knowledge, Nor does a foolish person understand this:",
  "When the wicked sprouted up like grass And all who did injustice flourished, It was only that they might be destroyed forevermore.",
  "But You, Lord, are on high forever.",
  "For, behold, Your enemies, Lord, For, behold, Your enemies will perish; All who do injustice will be scattered.",
  "But You have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.",
  "And my eye has looked at my enemies, My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me.",
  "The righteous person will flourish like the palm tree, He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.",
  "Planted in the house of the Lord, They will flourish in the courtyards of our God.",
  "They will still yield fruit in advanced age; They will be full of sap and very green,",
  "To declare that the Lord is just; He is my rock, and there is no malice in Him."
