  "Sing to the Lord a new song; Sing to the Lord, all the earth.",
  "Sing to the Lord, bless His name; Proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day.",
  "Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples.",
  "For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.",
  "For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the Lord made the heavens.",
  "Splendor and majesty are before Him, Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.",
  "Ascribe to the Lord, you families of the peoples, Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.",
  "Ascribe to the Lord the glory of His name; Bring an offering and come into His courtyards.",
  "Worship the Lord in holy attire; Tremble before Him, all the earth.",
  "Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved; He will judge the peoples fairly.”",
  "May the heavens be joyful, and may the earth rejoice; May the sea roar, and all it contains;",
  "May the field be jubilant, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy",
  "Before the Lord, for He is coming, For He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, And the peoples in His faithfulness."
