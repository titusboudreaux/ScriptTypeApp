  "As the deer pants for the water brooks, So my soul pants for You, God.",
  "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; When shall I come and appear before God?",
  "My tears have been my food day and night, While they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”",
  "I remember these things and pour out my soul within me. For I used to go over with the multitude and walk them to the house of God, With a voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude celebrating a festival.",
  "Why are you in despair, my soul? And why are you restless within me? Wait for God, for I will again praise Him For the help of His presence, my God.",
  "My soul is in despair within me; Therefore I remember You from the land of the Jordan And the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.",
  "Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; All Your breakers and Your waves have passed over me.",
  "The Lord will send His goodness in the daytime; And His song will be with me in the night, A prayer to the God of my life.",
  "I will say to God my rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”",
  "As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries taunt me, While they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”",
  "Why are you in despair, my soul? And why are you restless within me? Wait for God, for I will again praise Him For the help of His presence, my God."
