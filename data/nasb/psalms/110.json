  "The Lord says to my Lord: “Sit at My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”",
  "The Lord will stretch out Your strong scepter from Zion, saying, “Rule in the midst of Your enemies.”",
  "Your people will volunteer freely on the day of Your power; In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, Your youth are to You as the dew.",
  "The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind, “You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek.”",
  "The Lord is at Your right hand; He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath.",
  "He will judge among the nations, He will fill them with corpses, He will shatter the chief men over a broad country.",
  "He will drink from the brook by the wayside; Therefore He will lift up His head."
