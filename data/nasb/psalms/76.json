  "God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.",
  "His tabernacle is in Salem; His dwelling place also is in Zion.",
  "There He broke the flaming arrows, The shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah",
  "You are resplendent, More majestic than the mountains of prey.",
  "The stouthearted were plundered, They sank into sleep; And none of the warriors could use his hands.",
  "At Your rebuke, God of Jacob, Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep.",
  "You, You indeed are to be feared, And who may stand in Your presence, once You are angry?",
  "You caused judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared and was still",
  "When God arose to judgment, To save all the humble of the earth. Selah",
  "For the wrath of mankind shall praise You; You will encircle Yourself with a remnant of wrath.",
  "Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them; All who are around Him are to bring gifts to Him who is to be feared.",
  "He will cut off the spirit of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth."
