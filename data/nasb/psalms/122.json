  "I was glad when they said to me, “Let’s go to the house of the Lord.”",
  "Our feet are standing Within your gates, Jerusalem,",
  "Jerusalem, that has been built As a city that is firmly joined together;",
  "To which the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord— An ordinance for Israel— To give thanks to the name of the Lord.",
  "For thrones were set there for judgment, The thrones of the house of David.",
  "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May they prosper who love you.",
  "May peace be within your walls, And prosperity within your palaces.”",
  "For the sake of my brothers and my friends, I will now say, “May peace be within you.”",
  "For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your good."
