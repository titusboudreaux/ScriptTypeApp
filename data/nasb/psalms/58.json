  "Do you indeed speak righteousness, you gods? Do you judge fairly, you sons of mankind?",
  "No, in heart you practice injustice; On earth you clear a way for the violence of your hands.",
  "The wicked have turned away from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth.",
  "They have venom like the venom of a serpent; Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear,",
  "So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, Or a skillful caster of spells.",
  "God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; Break out the fangs of the young lions, Lord.",
  "May they flow away like water that runs off; When he aims his arrows, may they be as headless shafts.",
  "May they be like a snail which goes along in slime, Like the miscarriage of a woman that never sees the sun.",
  "Before your pots can feel the fire of thorns He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.",
  "The righteous will rejoice when he sees vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.",
  "And people will say, “There certainly is a reward for the righteous; There certainly is a God who judges on the earth!”"
