  "Lord, how my enemies have increased! Many are rising up against me.",
  "Many are saying of my soul, “There is no salvation for him in God.” Selah",
  "But You, Lord, are a shield around me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head.",
  "I was crying out to the Lord with my voice, And He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah",
  "I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustains me.",
  "I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around.",
  "Arise, Lord; save me, my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheek; You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.",
  "Salvation belongs to the Lord; May Your blessing be upon Your people! Selah"
