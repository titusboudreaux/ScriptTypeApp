  "Rescue me, Lord, from evil people; Protect me from violent men",
  "Who devise evil things in their hearts; They continually stir up wars.",
  "They sharpen their tongues like a snake; The venom of a viper is under their lips. Selah",
  "Keep me, Lord, from the hands of the wicked; Protect me from violent men Who intend to trip up my feet.",
  "The proud have hidden a trap for me, and snares; They have spread a net at the wayside; They have set snares for me. Selah",
  "I said to the Lord, “You are my God; Listen, Lord, to the sound of my pleadings.",
  "God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head on the day of battle.",
  "Do not grant, Lord, the desires of the wicked; Do not bring about his evil planning, so that they are not exalted. Selah",
  "“As for the head of those who surround me, May the harm of their lips cover them.",
  "May burning coals fall upon them; May they be cast into the fire, Into bottomless pits from which they cannot rise.",
  "May a slanderer not endure on the earth; May evil hunt a violent person violently.”",
  "I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And justice for the poor.",
  "Certainly the righteous will give thanks to Your name; The upright will dwell in Your presence."
