  "Praise the Lord! For it is good to sing praises to our God; For it is pleasant and praise is beautiful.",
  "The Lord builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the outcasts of Israel.",
  "He heals the brokenhearted And binds up their wounds.",
  "He counts the number of the stars; He gives names to all of them.",
  "Great is our Lord and abundant in strength; His understanding is infinite.",
  "The Lord supports the afflicted; He brings the wicked down to the ground.",
  "Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; Sing praises to our God on the lyre;",
  "It is He who covers the heavens with clouds, Who provides rain for the earth, Who makes grass sprout on the mountains.",
  "It is He who gives an animal its food, And feeds young ravens that cry.",
  "He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He does not take pleasure in the legs of a man.",
  "The Lord favors those who fear Him, Those who wait for His faithfulness.",
  "Praise the Lord, Jerusalem! Praise your God, Zion!",
  "For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your sons among you.",
  "He makes peace in your borders; He satisfies you with the finest of the wheat.",
  "He sends His command to the earth; His word runs very swiftly.",
  "He showers snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes.",
  "He hurls His ice as fragments; Who can stand before His cold?",
  "He sends His word and makes them melt; He makes His wind blow, and the waters flow.",
  "He declares His words to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.",
  "He has not dealt this way with any other nation; And as for His judgments, they have not known them. Praise the Lord!"
