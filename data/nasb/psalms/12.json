  "Help, Lord, for the godly person has come to an end, For the faithful have disappeared from the sons of mankind.",
  "They speak lies to one another; They speak with flattering lips and a double heart.",
  "May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaks great things;",
  "Who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?”",
  "“Because of the devastation of the poor, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise,” says the Lord; “I will put him in the safety for which he longs.”",
  "The words of the Lord are pure words; Like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, filtered seven times.",
  "You, Lord, will keep them; You will protect him from this generation forever.",
  "The wicked strut about on every side When vileness is exalted among the sons of mankind."
