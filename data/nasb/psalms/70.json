  "God, hurry to save me; Lord, hurry to help me!",
  "May those who seek my life Be put to shame and humiliated; May those who delight in my harm Be turned back and dishonored.",
  "May those who say, “Aha, aha!” be turned back Because of their shame.",
  "May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; And may those who love Your salvation say continually, “May God be exalted!”",
  "But I am afflicted and needy; Hurry to me, God! You are my help and my savior; Lord, do not delay."
