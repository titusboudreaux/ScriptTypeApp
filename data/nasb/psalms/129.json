  "“Many times they have attacked me from my youth up,” Let Israel say,",
  "“Many times they have attacked me from my youth up; Yet they have not prevailed against me.",
  "The plowers plowed upon my back; They lengthened their furrows.”",
  "The Lord is righteous; He has cut up the ropes of the wicked.",
  "May all who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned backward;",
  "May they be like grass upon the housetops, Which withers before it grows up;",
  "With which the harvester does not fill his hand, Or the binder of sheaves his arms;",
  "Nor do those who pass by say, “The blessing of the Lord be upon you; We bless you in the name of the Lord.”"
