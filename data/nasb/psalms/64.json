  "Hear my voice, God, in my complaint; Protect my life from dread of the enemy.",
  "Hide me from the secret discussion of evildoers, From the restlessness of the workers of injustice,",
  "Who have sharpened their tongues like a sword. They aimed bitter speech as their arrows,",
  "To shoot from concealment at the innocent; Suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear.",
  "They make firm for themselves an evil purpose; They talk of setting snares secretly; They say, “Who can see them?”",
  "They devise injustices, saying, “We are ready with a well-conceived plot”; For the inward thought and the heart of a person are deep.",
  "But God will shoot an arrow at them; Suddenly they will be wounded.",
  "So they will make him stumble; Their own tongue is against them; All who see them will shake their heads.",
  "Then all people will fear, And they will declare the work of God, And will consider what He has done.",
  "The righteous person will be glad in the Lord and take refuge in Him; And all the upright in heart will boast."
