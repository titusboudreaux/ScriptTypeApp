  "I said, “I will keep watch over my ways So that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep watch over my mouth as with a muzzle While the wicked are in my presence.”",
  "I was mute and silent, I refused to say even something good, And my pain was stirred up.",
  "My heart was hot within me, While I was musing the fire burned; Then I spoke with my tongue:",
  "“Lord, let me know my end, And what is the extent of my days; Let me know how transient I am.",
  "Behold, You have made my days like hand widths, And my lifetime as nothing in Your sight; Certainly all mankind standing is a mere breath. Selah",
  "Certainly every person walks around as a fleeting shadow; They certainly make an uproar for nothing; He amasses riches and does not know who will gather them.",
  "“And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You.",
  "Save me from all my wrongdoings; Do not make me an object of reproach for the foolish.",
  "I have become mute, I do not open my mouth, Because it is You who have done it.",
  "Remove Your plague from me; Because of the opposition of Your hand I am perishing.",
  "With rebukes You punish a person for wrongdoing; You consume like a moth what is precious to him; Certainly all mankind is mere breath! Selah",
  "“Hear my prayer, Lord, and listen to my cry for help; Do not be silent to my tears; For I am a stranger with You, One who lives abroad, like all my fathers.",
  "Turn Your eyes away from me, that I may become cheerful again Before I depart and am no more.”"
