  "God, You are my God; I shall be watching for You; My soul thirsts for You, my flesh yearns for You, In a dry and exhausted land where there is no water.",
  "So have I seen You in the sanctuary, To see Your power and glory.",
  "Because Your favor is better than life, My lips will praise You.",
  "So I will bless You as long as I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.",
  "My soul is satisfied as with fat and fatness, And my mouth offers praises with joyful lips.",
  "When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches,",
  "For You have been my help, And in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy.",
  "My soul clings to You; Your right hand takes hold of me.",
  "But those who seek my life to destroy it, Will go into the depths of the earth.",
  "They will be turned over to the power of the sword; They will be a prey for foxes.",
  "But the king will rejoice in God; Everyone who swears by Him will boast, For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped."
