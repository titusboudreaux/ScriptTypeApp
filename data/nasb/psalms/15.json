[
  "Lord, who may reside in Your tent? Who may settle on Your holy hill?",
  "One who walks with integrity, practices righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart.",
  "He does not slander with his tongue, Nor do evil to his neighbor, Nor bring shame on his friend;",
  "A despicable person is despised in his eyes, But he honors those who fear the Lord; He takes an oath to his own detriment, and does not change;",
  "He does not lend his money at interest, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. One who does these things will never be shaken."
