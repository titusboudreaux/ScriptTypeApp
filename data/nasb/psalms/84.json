  "How lovely are Your dwelling places, Lord of armies!",
  "My soul longed and even yearned for the courtyards of the Lord; My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.",
  "The bird also has found a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may put her young: Your altars, Lord of armies, My King and my God.",
  "Blessed are those who dwell in Your house! They are ever praising You. Selah",
  "Blessed is the person whose strength is in You, In whose heart are the roads to Zion!",
  "Passing through the Valley of Baca they make it a spring; The early rain also covers it with blessings.",
  "They go from strength to strength, Every one of them appears before God in Zion.",
  "Lord God of armies, hear my prayer; Listen, God of Jacob! Selah",
  "See our shield, God, And look at the face of Your anointed.",
  "For a day in Your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God Than live in the tents of wickedness.",
  "For the Lord God is a sun and shield; The Lord gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.",
  "Lord of armies, Blessed is the person who trusts in You!"
