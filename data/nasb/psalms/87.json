  "His foundation is in the holy mountains.",
  "The Lord loves the gates of Zion More than all the other dwelling places of Jacob.",
  "Glorious things are spoken of you, City of God. Selah",
  "“I shall mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me; Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Cush: ‘This one was born there.’”",
  "But of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one were born in her”; And the Most High Himself will establish her.",
  "The Lord will count when He registers the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah",
  "Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes will say, “All my springs of joy are in you.”"
