  "Remember, Lord, in David’s behalf, All his affliction;",
  "How he swore to the Lord And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,",
  "“I certainly will not enter my house, Nor lie on my bed;",
  "I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids,",
  "Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”",
  "Behold, we heard about it in Ephrathah, We found it in the field of Jaar.",
  "Let’s go into His dwelling place; Let’s worship at His footstool.",
  "Arise, Lord, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.",
  "May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, And may Your godly ones sing for joy.",
  "For the sake of Your servant David, Do not turn away the face of Your anointed.",
  "The Lord has sworn to David A truth from which He will not turn back: “I will set upon your throne one from the fruit of your body.",
  "If your sons will keep My covenant And My testimony which I will teach them, Their sons also will sit upon your throne forever.”",
  "For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it as His dwelling place.",
  "“This is My resting place forever; Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.",
  "I will abundantly bless her food; I will satisfy her needy with bread.",
  "I will also clothe her priests with salvation, And her godly ones will sing aloud for joy.",
  "I will make the horn of David spring forth there; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed.",
  "I will clothe his enemies with shame, But upon himself his crown will gleam.”"
