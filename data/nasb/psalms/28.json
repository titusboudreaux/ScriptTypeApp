  "To You, Lord, I call; My rock, do not be deaf to me, For if You are silent to me, I will become like those who go down to the pit.",
  "Hear the sound of my pleadings when I cry to You for help, When I raise my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.",
  "Do not drag me away with the wicked And with those who practice injustice, Who speak peace with their neighbors, While evil is in their hearts.",
  "Give back to them according to their work and according to the evil of their practices; Give back to them according to the work of their hands; Repay them what is due them.",
  "Because they do not regard the works of the Lord Nor the deeds of His hands, He will tear them down and not build them up.",
  "Blessed be the Lord, Because He has heard the sound of my pleading.",
  "The Lord is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart triumphs, And with my song I shall thank Him.",
  "The Lord is their strength, And He is a refuge of salvation to His anointed.",
  "Save Your people and bless Your inheritance; Be their shepherd also, and carry them forever."
