  "Be gracious to me, God, be gracious to me, For my soul takes refuge in You; And in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge Until destruction passes by.",
  "I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes all things for me.",
  "He will send from heaven and save me; He rebukes the one who tramples upon me. Selah God will send His favor and His truth.",
  "My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who devour, Among sons of mankind whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue is a sharp sword.",
  "Be exalted above the heavens, God; May Your glory be above all the earth.",
  "They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They dug a pit before me; They themselves have fallen into the midst of it. Selah",
  "My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises!",
  "Awake, my glory! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.",
  "I will praise You, Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to You among the nations.",
  "For Your goodness is great to the heavens And Your truth to the clouds.",
  "Be exalted above the heavens, God; May Your glory be above all the earth."
