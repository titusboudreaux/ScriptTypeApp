  "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens; Praise Him in the heights!",
  "Praise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His heavenly armies!",
  "Praise Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all stars of light!",
  "Praise Him, highest heavens, And the waters that are above the heavens!",
  "They are to praise the name of the Lord, For He commanded and they were created.",
  "He has also established them forever and ever; He has made a decree, and it will not pass away.",
  "Praise the Lord from the earth, Sea monsters, and all the ocean depths;",
  "Fire and hail, snow and clouds; Stormy wind, fulfilling His word;",
  "Mountains and all hills; Fruit trees and all cedars;",
  "Animals and all cattle; Crawling things and winged fowl;",
  "Kings of the earth and all peoples; Rulers and all judges of the earth;",
  "Both young men and virgins; Old men and children.",
  "They are to praise the name of the Lord, For His name alone is exalted; His majesty is above earth and heaven.",
  "And He has lifted up a horn for His people, Praise for all His godly ones, For the sons of Israel, a people near to Him. Praise the Lord!"
