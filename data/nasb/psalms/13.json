[
  "How long, Lord? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?",
  "How long am I to feel anxious in my soul, With grief in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?",
  "Consider and answer me, O Lord my God; Enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death,",
  "And my enemy will say, “I have overcome him,” And my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken.",
  "But I have trusted in Your faithfulness; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.",
  "I will sing to the Lord, Because He has looked after me."
