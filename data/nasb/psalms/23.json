  "The Lord is my shepherd, I will not be in need.",
  "He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.",
  "He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness For the sake of His name.",
  "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.",
  "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows.",
  "Certainly goodness and faithfulness will follow me all the days of my life, And my dwelling will be in the house of the Lord forever."
