  "Save me, God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your power.",
  "Hear my prayer, God; Listen to the words of my mouth.",
  "For strangers have risen against me And violent men have sought my life; They have not set God before them. Selah",
  "Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is the sustainer of my soul.",
  "He will pay back the evil to my enemies; Destroy them in Your faithfulness.",
  "Willingly I will sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, Lord, for it is good.",
  "For He has saved me from all trouble, And my eye has looked with satisfaction upon my enemies."
