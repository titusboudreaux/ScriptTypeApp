  "God, You have rejected us. You have broken us; You have been angry; restore us!",
  "You have made the land quake, You have split it open; Heal its cracks, for it sways.",
  "You have made Your people experience hardship; You have given us wine to drink that makes us stagger.",
  "You have given a banner to those who fear You, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah",
  "That Your beloved may be rescued, Save us with Your right hand, and answer us!",
  "God has spoken in His holiness: “I will triumph, I will divide up Shechem, and measure out the Valley of Succoth.",
  "Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.",
  "Moab is My washbowl; I will throw My sandal over Edom; Shout loud, Philistia, because of Me!”",
  "Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?",
  "Have You Yourself not rejected us, God? And will You not go out with our armies, God?",
  "Oh give us help against the enemy, For rescue by man is worthless.",
  "Through God we will do valiantly, And it is He who will trample down our enemies."
