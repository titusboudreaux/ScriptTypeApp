  "Sing a new song to the Lord, For He has done wonderful things, His right hand and His holy arm have gained the victory for Him.",
  "The Lord has made His salvation known; He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations.",
  "He has remembered His graciousness and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.",
  "Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth; Be cheerful and sing for joy and sing praises.",
  "Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre, With the lyre and the sound of melody.",
  "With trumpets and the sound of the horn Shout joyfully before the King, the Lord.",
  "May the sea roar and all it contains, The world and those who dwell in it.",
  "May the rivers clap their hands, May the mountains sing together for joy",
  "Before the Lord, for He is coming to judge the earth; He will judge the world with righteousness And the peoples with fairness."
