  "Rescue me from my enemies, my God; Set me securely on high away from those who rise up against me.",
  "Rescue me from those who practice injustice, And save me from men of bloodshed.",
  "For behold, they have set an ambush for my life; Fierce men attack me, Not for my wrongdoing nor for my sin, Lord,",
  "For no guilt of mine, they run and take their stand against me. Stir Yourself to help me, and see!",
  "You, Lord God of armies, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be gracious to any who deal treacherously in wrongdoing. Selah",
  "They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And prowl around the city.",
  "Behold, they gush forth with their mouths; Swords are in their lips, For, they say, “Who hears?”",
  "But You, Lord, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations.",
  "Because of his strength I will watch for You, For God is my refuge.",
  "My God in His faithfulness will meet me; God will let me look triumphantly upon my enemies.",
  "Do not kill them, or my people will forget; Scatter them by Your power and bring them down, Lord, our shield.",
  "On account of the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips, May they even be caught in their pride, And on account of curses and lies which they tell.",
  "Destroy them in wrath, destroy them so that they will no longer exist; So that people may know that God rules in Jacob, To the ends of the earth. Selah",
  "They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And prowl around the city.",
  "They wander about for food And murmur if they are not satisfied.",
  "But as for me, I will sing of Your strength; Yes, I will joyfully sing of Your faithfulness in the morning, For You have been my refuge And a place of refuge on the day of my distress.",
  "My strength, I will sing praises to You; For God is my refuge, the God who shows me favor."
