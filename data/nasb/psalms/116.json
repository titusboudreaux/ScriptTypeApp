  "I love the Lord, because He hears My voice and my pleas.",
  "Because He has inclined His ear to me, Therefore I will call upon Him as long as I live.",
  "The snares of death encompassed me And the terrors of Sheol came upon me; I found distress and sorrow.",
  "Then I called upon the name of the Lord: “Please, Lord, save my life!”",
  "Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; Yes, our God is compassionate.",
  "The Lord watches over the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.",
  "Return to your rest, my soul, For the Lord has dealt generously with you.",
  "For You have rescued my soul from death, My eyes from tears, And my feet from stumbling.",
  "I shall walk before the Lord In the land of the living.",
  "I believed when I said, “I am greatly afflicted.”",
  "I said in my alarm, “All people are liars.”",
  "What shall I repay to the Lord For all His benefits to me?",
  "I will lift up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the Lord.",
  "I will pay my vows to the Lord; May it be in the presence of all His people!",
  "Precious in the sight of the Lord Is the death of His godly ones.",
  "O Lord, I surely am Your slave, I am Your slave, the son of Your female slave, You have unfastened my restraints.",
  "I will offer You a sacrifice of thanksgiving, And call upon the name of the Lord.",
  "I will pay my vows to the Lord, May it be in the presence of all His people,",
  "In the courtyards of the Lord’s house, In the midst of you, Jerusalem! Praise the Lord!"
