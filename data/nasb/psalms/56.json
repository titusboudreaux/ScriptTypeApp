  "Be gracious to me, God, for a man has trampled upon me; Fighting all day long he oppresses me.",
  "My enemies have trampled upon me all day long, For they are many who fight proudly against me.",
  "When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.",
  "In God, whose word I praise, In God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?",
  "All day long they distort my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.",
  "They attack, they lurk, They watch my steps, As they have waited to take my life.",
  "Because of their wickedness, will there be an escape for them? In anger make the peoples fall down, God!",
  "You have taken account of my miseries; Put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book?",
  "Then my enemies will turn back on the day when I call; This I know, that God is for me.",
  "In God, whose word I praise, In the Lord, whose word I praise,",
  "In God I have put my trust, I shall not be afraid. What can mankind do to me?",
  "Your vows are binding upon me, God; I will render thanksgiving offerings to You.",
  "For You have saved my soul from death, Indeed my feet from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the living."
