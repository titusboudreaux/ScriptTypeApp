  "God is our refuge and strength, A very ready help in trouble.",
  "Therefore we will not fear, though the earth shakes And the mountains slip into the heart of the sea;",
  "Though its waters roar and foam, Though the mountains quake at its swelling pride. Selah",
  "There is a river whose streams make the city of God happy, The holy dwelling places of the Most High.",
  "God is in the midst of her, she will not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns.",
  "The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered; He raised His voice, the earth quaked.",
  "The Lord of armies is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah",
  "Come, behold the works of the Lord, Who has inflicted horrific events on the earth.",
  "He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots with fire.",
  "“Stop striving and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted on the earth.”",
  "The Lord of armies is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah"
