  "There will be silence before You, and praise in Zion, God, And the vow will be fulfilled for You.",
  "You who hear prayer, To You all mankind comes.",
  "Wrongdoings prevail against me; As for our offenses, You forgive them.",
  "Blessed is the one You choose and allow to approach You; He will dwell in Your courtyards. We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, Your holy temple.",
  "By awesome deeds You answer us in righteousness, God of our salvation, You who are the trust of all the ends of the earth and the farthest sea;",
  "Who establishes the mountains by His strength, Who is encircled with might;",
  "Who stills the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the turmoil of the nations.",
  "They who dwell at the ends of the earth stand in awe of Your signs; You make the sunrise and the sunset shout for joy.",
  "You visit the earth and cause it to overflow; You greatly enrich it; The stream of God is full of water; You prepare their grain, for so You prepare the earth.",
  "You water its furrows abundantly, You settle its ridges, You soften it with showers, You bless its growth.",
  "You have crowned the year with Your goodness, And Your paths drip with fatness.",
  "The pastures of the wilderness drip, And the hills encircle themselves with rejoicing.",
  "The meadows are clothed with flocks And the valleys are covered with grain; They shout for joy, yes, they sing."
