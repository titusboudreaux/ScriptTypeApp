  "Hear a just cause, Lord, give Your attention to my cry; Listen to my prayer, which is not from deceitful lips.",
  "Let my judgment come forth from Your presence; Let Your eyes look with integrity.",
  "You have put my heart to the test; You have visited me by night; You have sifted me and You find nothing; My intent is that my mouth will not offend.",
  "As for the works of mankind, by the word of Your lips I have kept from the ways of the violent.",
  "My steps have held to Your paths. My feet have not slipped.",
  "I have called upon You, for You will answer me, God; Incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.",
  "Show Your wonderful faithfulness, Savior of those who take refuge at Your right hand From those who rise up against them.",
  "Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings",
  "From the wicked who deal violently with me, My deadly enemies who surround me.",
  "They have closed their unfeeling hearts, With their mouths they speak proudly.",
  "They have now surrounded us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast us down to the ground.",
  "He is like a lion that is eager to tear, And as a young lion lurking in secret places.",
  "Arise, Lord, confront him, make him bow down; Save my soul from the wicked with Your sword,",
  "From people by Your hand, Lord, From people of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly You fill with Your treasure; They are satisfied with children, And leave their abundance to their babies.",
  "As for me, I shall behold Your face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied with Your likeness when I awake."
