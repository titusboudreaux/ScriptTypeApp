  "The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice; There is no one who does good.",
  "God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of mankind To see if there is anyone who understands, Who seeks after God.",
  "Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.",
  "Have the workers of injustice no knowledge, Who eat up My people like they ate bread, And have not called upon God?",
  "They were in great fear there, where no fear had been; For God scattered the bones of him who encamped against you; You put them to shame, because God had rejected them.",
  "Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When God restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, Israel shall be glad."
