  "I will exalt You, Lord, for You have lifted me up, And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.",
  "Lord my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me.",
  "Lord, You have brought up my soul from Sheol; You have kept me alive, that I would not go down to the pit.",
  "Sing praise to the Lord, you His godly ones, And praise the mention of His holiness.",
  "For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, But a shout of joy comes in the morning.",
  "Now as for me, I said in my prosperity, “I will never be moved.”",
  "Lord, by Your favor You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face, I was dismayed.",
  "To You, Lord, I called, And to the Lord I pleaded for compassion:",
  "“What gain is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness?",
  "“Hear, Lord, and be gracious to me; Lord, be my helper.”",
  "You have turned my mourning into dancing for me; You have untied my sackcloth and encircled me with joy,",
  "That my soul may sing praise to You and not be silent. Lord my God, I will give thanks to You forever."
