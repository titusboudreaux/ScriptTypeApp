  "Listen, Shepherd of Israel, Who leads Joseph like a flock; You who are enthroned above the cherubim, shine forth!",
  "Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, awaken Your power, And come to save us!",
  "God, restore us And make Your face shine upon us, and we will be saved.",
  "Lord God of armies, How long will You be angry with the prayer of Your people?",
  "You have fed them with the bread of tears, And You have made them drink tears in large measure.",
  "You make us an object of contention to our neighbors, And our enemies laugh among themselves.",
  "God of armies, restore us And make Your face shine upon us, and we will be saved.",
  "You removed a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and planted it.",
  "You cleared the ground before it, And it took deep root and filled the land.",
  "The mountains were covered with its shadow, And the cedars of God with its branches.",
  "It was sending out its branches to the sea And its shoots to the Euphrates River.",
  "Why have You broken down its hedges, So that all who pass that way pick its fruit?",
  "A boar from the forest eats it away, And whatever moves in the field feeds on it.",
  "God of armies, do turn back; Look down from heaven and see, and take care of this vine,",
  "The shoot which Your right hand has planted, And of the son whom You have strengthened for Yourself.",
  "It is burned with fire, it is cut down; They perish from the rebuke of Your face.",
  "Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, Upon the son of man whom You made strong for Yourself.",
  "Then we will not turn back from You; Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.",
  "Lord God of armies, restore us; Make Your face shine upon us, and we will be saved."
