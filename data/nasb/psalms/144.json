  "Blessed be the Lord, my rock, Who trains my hands for war, And my fingers for battle;",
  "My faithfulness and my fortress, My stronghold and my savior, My shield and He in whom I take refuge, Who subdues my people under me.",
  "Lord, what is man, that You look after him? Or a son of man, that You think of him?",
  "Man is like the breath; His days are like a passing shadow.",
  "Bend down Your heavens, Lord, and come down; Touch the mountains, that they may smoke.",
  "Flash forth lightning and scatter them; Send out Your arrows and confuse them.",
  "Reach out with Your hand from on high; Rescue me and save me from great waters, From the hand of foreigners",
  "Whose mouth speaks deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.",
  "God, I will sing a new song to You; On a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You,",
  "Who gives salvation to kings, Who rescues His servant David from the evil sword.",
  "Rescue me and save me from the hand of foreigners, Whose mouth speaks deceit And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.",
  "When our sons in their youth are like growing plants, And our daughters like corner pillars fashioned for a palace,",
  "Our granaries are full, providing every kind of produce, And our flocks deliver thousands and ten thousands in our fields;",
  "May our cattle be bred Without mishap and without loss, May there be no outcry in our streets!",
  "Blessed are the people who are so situated; Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord!"
