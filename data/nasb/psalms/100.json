  "Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth.",
  "Serve the Lord with jubilation; Come before Him with rejoicing.",
  "Know that the Lord Himself is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; We are His people and the sheep of His pasture.",
  "Enter His gates with thanksgiving, And His courtyards with praise. Give thanks to Him, bless His name.",
  "For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting And His faithfulness is to all generations."
