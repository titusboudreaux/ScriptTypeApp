  "Why do You stand far away, Lord? Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?",
  "In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the needy; Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.",
  "For the wicked boasts of his soul’s desire, And the greedy person curses and shows disrespect to the Lord.",
  "The wicked, in his haughtiness, does not seek Him. There is no God in all his schemes.",
  "His ways succeed at all times; Yet Your judgments are on high, out of his sight; As for all his enemies, he snorts at them.",
  "He says to himself, “I will not be moved; Throughout the generations I will not be in adversity.”",
  "His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression; Under his tongue is harm and injustice.",
  "He sits in the lurking places of the villages; He kills the innocent in the secret places; His eyes surreptitiously watch for the unfortunate.",
  "He lurks in secret like a lion in his lair; He lurks to catch the needy; He catches the needy when he pulls him into his net.",
  "Then he crushes the needy one, who cowers; And unfortunate people fall by his mighty power.",
  "He says to himself, “God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see it.”",
  "Arise, Lord; God, lift up Your hand. Do not forget the humble.",
  "Why has the wicked treated God disrespectfully? He has said to himself, “You will not require an account.”",
  "You have seen it, for You have looked at harm and provocation to take it into Your hand. The unfortunate commits himself to You; You have been the helper of the orphan.",
  "Break the arm of the wicked and the evildoer, Seek out his wickedness until You find none.",
  "The Lord is King forever and ever; Nations have perished from His land.",
  "Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their heart, You will make Your ear attentive",
  "To vindicate the orphan and the oppressed, So that mankind, which is of the earth, will no longer cause terror."
